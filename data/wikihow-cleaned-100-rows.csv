0,"keep related supplies in the same area . make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session . place loose supplies in large , clearly visible containers . use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches , photos , and reference material . use every inch of the room for storage , especially vertical space . use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls . purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi - permanent . make a habit of throwing out old , excess , or useless stuff each month .",how to be an organized artist 1,"if youre a photographer , keep all the necessary lens , cords , and batteries in the same quadrant of your home or studio . paints should be kept with brushes , cleaner , and canvas , print supplies should be by the ink , etc . make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier , limiting your search to a much smaller area . some ideas include essential supplies area - - the things you use every day . inspiration and reference area . dedicated work area . infrequent or secondary supplies area , tucked out of the way . this doesnt mean cleaning the entire studio , it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk , easel , pottery wheel , etc . clean each night . discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces . endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately , without having to do any work or tidying . even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized , an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art . as visual people , a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight . by using jars , old glasses , vases , and cheap , clear plastic drawers , you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly . some ideas , beyond those just mentioned , include canvas shoe racks on the back of the door wine racks with cups in each slot to hold penspencils . plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint , pigment , etc . simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you dont want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape . cheap and easy , this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration . shelving is an artists best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space . dont be afraid to get up high either , especially for infrequently used supplies . the upper reaches of the room are often the most under - utilized , but provide vital space for all your tools and materials . turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas , sketches , and planning without requiring extra equipment or space . you can even use it for smaller areas . paint over jars or storage equipment , allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change . a lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things , trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently . this usually has the opposite effect , leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning , but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything . instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things , you can just follow the labels , freeing your mind to think about art . once a month , do a purge of your studio . if it isnt essential or part of a project , either throw it out or file it away for later . artists are constantly making new things , experimenting , and making a mess . this is a good thing , but only if you set aside time to declutter . it may not be fun at the moment , but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch . dont be sentimental here . if you havent used it in the last six months there is little chance youll use it in the next six months . toss it ."
1,"create a sketch in the neopoprealist manner of the future mural on a small piece of paper 8x10 using the black ink pen . prepare to create your neopoprealist mural . prepare your paint . begin your project with a design . produce a scaled down version of your finished mural . prepare the wall to be painted . after you have primed the surface , measure the wall . paint in the base coat of the background . allow the background and base coats to dry . draw the lines , then fill the appeared section with different repetitive patterns examine the images above . paint patterns with brushes of suitable size for the particular portion of work you are painting . clean up the lines and shapes as needed . seal the mural if needed . be inspired and it will help you succeed",how to create a neopoprealist art work,"see the image for how this drawing develops step - by - step . however , there is an important detail the following drawings are to examine it , and then , to create something unique . use the lines to create the image shape and sections . fill appeared sections with different patterns ornaments . add text if needed , for example neopoprealism is 25 add a colored strip on the top , any color you wish . painting a mural always requires some preparation . youâ€˜ll need equipment and effort , but planning and attention to detail will help you succeed . painting a mural requires a suitable location , with the right surface that can be painted . this surface should be smooth and flat . however , even rough - textured surfaces can be used for your neopoprealist mural project . for exterior projects that last for years , using a newer 100 acrylic exterior paint would be your best choice . for interior walls , use latex paints . latex offer easier cleanup and lower costs . by measuring the total wall area to be covered , the total amount of paint can be calculated , but since this mural painting requires two colors - white and black - figuring the actual area to be painted each color is necessary to allow purchasing the right amount of each one . large walls backgrounds may be rolled or sprayed with a white paint sprayer , where details may be added with brushes . paints are sensitive to high temperatures , humidity , direct sunlight , however , the interior projects do not have many complications . in public places , keeping the mural protected may require attention . for that reason , if you make your neopoprealist mural dedicated to its 25 - year anniversary in school or office , you can consider using varnish for your mural . see sample above . the design will give you a sense of proportion . you will have unique requirements and elements . use a sketch and measure at scale the distances and locations of various points of your subject . measuring key features will help you calculate the amount of paint when each feature is identified by its color . if the surface is low , the whole mural can be painted standing on the ground or from a stepladder . for higher work , you may have to rent a scaffold . mark the horizontal and vertical lines . use white paint as background . then begin marking , using your scaled sketch , the location of key elements of objects , located in the foreground . everything depends on the complexity of your mural . if you are confident in your artistic results , you may choose to draw all of the details in freehand . be careful , keep clean transition edges from one color black to another white . however , mistakes can be touched up later . always allow fresh color to dry before proceeding to the drawing . an example would be painting a large patterns use big brushes , limbs , use small brushes for tiny and detailed patterns . if you have a drip or run , paint over it with the color paint appropriate for that location . sharpen lines and patterns if they are blurred . if it is intended to last a long time or if it is on a surface that require cleaning , overcoat your mural project with a clear sealer . however , if you wont be able to involve more than 16 percent of your brains grays matter , youll end up with the primitive crafting of patterns or even worse , with doodling or so - called zen - doodling . but to create the neopoprealist art one needs the abilities , which can be developed in talented people by studying using nadia russ neopoprealist instructional books . other , the copycats self - promotional superficial books will teach you only how to doodle because they have nothing in common with visual arts and its mission ."
2,"get a bachelors degree . enroll in a studio - based program . train on a number of vfx computer programs . watch online tutorials . nurture your artistic side . pay close attention to movies , television shows , and video games . develop a specialization .",how to be a visual effects artist 1,"it is possible to become a vfx artist without a college degree , but the path is often easier with one . vfx artists usually major in fine arts , computer graphics , or animation . choose a college with a reputation for strength in these areas and a reputation for good job placement for graduates . the availability of internships is another factor to consider . out of the jobs advertised for vfx artists , a majority at any given time specify a bachelors degree as a minimum requirement for applicants . some studios offer short - term programs for people who want to learn more about vfx artistry without pursuing a college degree . enrolling in these programs can be expensive as financial aid isnt always offered , but they usually have the most cutting edge technology for you to learn from . although you may create some hand sketches , the majority of your work will be completed on the computer using the most up - to - date programs . stay informed about the newest software advances by following vfx blogs and taking online computer tutorials . for example , vfx artists are expected to be well - versed in graphics and animation programs , such as adobe creative suite and javascript . clearly list every program that you can work with on your resume . hop onto youtube or another video service and search for vfx clip reels or demonstrations . some of these videos will focus on a particular skill set , such as shading , which you then can practice on your own . challenge yourself to mimic some of the more difficult tasks , or even try to improve upon the models used . take as many art and design classes as you can . or , simply carry a sketch pad around with you to work on your basic animation skills . as you draw , consider factors such as lighting and framing . even geometry skills can come in handy when creating a particular type of background or even a persons face . make a choice to become an observer of the world around you . ask yourself how could i capture the movement of the leaves or , in what situations do shadows appear watch all of these creations with an eye for detail . look for the techniques used and any original approaches that you see . try to recreate any scenes that you find particularly interesting . research the artists and see what their backgrounds are and contact them if you like . as you gain more experience , youll likely find yourself gravitating toward a certain aspect of design . this will become your calling card and directors and other professionals will seek you out for this type of work . to build your specialization , start choosing jobs with that emphasis and attend additional training seminars . for example , some vfx specialists focus on human characters faces , animal figures , or city backgrounds ."
3,"start with some experience or interest in art . understand the difference between art collectors , art investors and art speculators . figure out what you are willing to pay for art , before going to an auction house . pay attention to what schools of art are selling well , and which are down . focus art investments on fine art paintings , rather than decorative art . reach out to trusted auction houses and dealers when you are looking to buy art . buy your investment art when you feel confident of its worth , its price and its ability to grow in value . study how art is properly stored . have your art investments appraised occasionally . consider renting out your art investments . understand that selling an art investment can take time .",how to become an art investor,"the best art investors do their research on the pieces of art that they buy , so someone with some education or interest in the art world is more likely to understand this niche market . as well as personal research , you will need to have contacts with people in the art world , such as auctioneers , gallery directors and dealers , who can give you good investment advice . you may confuse these three terms , if you are not careful . each of them has a slightly different goal in mind when looking to buy art . art collectors do not buy art for investment purposes . they buy it to decorate and display in their home . because they consider them to be an important part of their home or life , most art collectors have a hard time parting with pieces of their collection . while many collectors do end up selling some pieces of art , it may be done because of necessity . collectors often loan their works out to museums and occasionally donate them to museums upon their death . art investors seek to diversify their portfolio with an art investment . some investment firms put about two and a half to three percent of their investment money in art . they seek good advice and often buy paintings that are older and have been popular historically , such as paintings by the old masters . these investments are kept over decades , and sold off when the market is right , with the investor seeking to get a six to ten percent profit rise per year . these investments are also often made to be given as inheritance to future generations of the family . art investment is often undertaken by the very wealthy . art speculators try to invest in art that they believe will appreciate in value . they aim to buy art at a low price from budding artists in the beginning of their careers . then they hope to sell their work in 10 to 15 years when the artists are at the peak of their careers and people or collectors are willing to pay much more for their pieces . this is a type of investment that takes intimate involvement with the art world and liquidity in order to buy the art . art investments should be no more than a small part of your investment portfolio , along with stocks , bonds , new businesses and more . figure out what your range is before you begin to pick out potential pieces , and get advice from investors and art dealers . study the mei moses fine art index to get a firm grasp of the art market today . although they cannot predict what will be popular in the future , they can tell you what art tends to keep its value and be a low - risk and what art has a more volatile market value . while this is not an absolute rule to follow , paintings from successful artists tend to get better returns than sculpture and installation art . get all the information you can out of them before making a purchase . if you are going to buy at auction , be prepared to walk away if the price goes higher than your investment range . beware of art auctioneers or dealers that promise too high a return on paintings . in many ways , they are just like stock brokers and other financial investment firms , who may promise anything to get a sale . they should be found trustworthy before you buy anything , because ponzi schemes and art market bubbles are part of this investment landscape as well . if you have never bought art in an auction environment before , you may want to seek advice about how it is done properly . you should study the auction booklet before hand , learn about secret buyers and how prices can quickly inflate . most fine auction houses would be willing to teach you the basics if they see you as a serious investor . arrange for payment , shipping and insurance . each piece of art should be insured and catalogued as part of your estate . in order for an art investment to retain its value , it should be kept at low - humidity and avoid being marred . you may choose to hang it in your home , but you may want to get an art collectors advice about where to hang it and how to care for it . share this information with your children , if it is intended as an inheritance investment . they need to be well aware of how to take care of art , or they may lose money or ruin the painting entirely . as well as keeping tabs on the art world to understand the rise and falls of certain schools of art , an appraiser can tell you how your investment is maturing . they may clue you in on when you have reached your desired profit . if the art you buy does not fit in your home , and you will only be storing it , research banks , hotels and other institutions that rent fine art on a rotating basis . you may be able to demand thousands of dollars per year for your art to hang in another building . keep in mind you will need to make sure your art is covered by an insurance policy for loss or damage . make sure the renter provides insurance for your art . you should prepare a contract that stipulates the time allotted , the fee , the insurance and the shipment of your art . unless you employ an art dealer or auction house at the exact moment when the art is in high value , it can take years and thousands of dollars in fees to find the right buyer ."
4,"keep your reference materials , sketches , articles , photos , etc , in one easy to find place . make studies , or practice sketches , to organize effectively for larger projects . limit the supplies you leave out to the project at hand . keep an updated list of all of the necessary supplies , and the quantities of each . break down bigger works into more easily completed parts .",how to be an organized artist 2,"as you start planning for a project or work , youll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches . while everyone has a strategy , there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to re - find the cool idea you saw three months ago . try out dedicating 1 notebook , preferably with insert folders , to each project . making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration . tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace . very few artists simply dive right into large projects . almost 100 of the time they instead work on related , smaller projects called studies to prepare for the larger work . you might practice the face of the portrait youre making , sketch our different composition ideas , or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture . keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills , ideas , and supplies needed for the final project . at the end of the day , artists are visual people , and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process . of course , neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies . find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use , and leaving a little bit of essential clutter . its okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio - - just make sure its the inspiration you need for the current project . just because you arent organized is no excuse not to make an attempt . dont feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess - - there is a middle ground . nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize youve run out of white paint halfway through a section . once a week , or more frequently if possible , check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem . a simple spreadsheet or notebook , marked at the end of each artistic session , is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff . deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking . but sketching the idea , transposing the image onto the wall , painting the basic colors , then adding shadingdetail are four separate and more manageable projects . organization is key to big projects , even if it feels constraining to your creativity . in reality , organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative , instead of worrying about logistics . figure out the building blocks of each part of the project , tackling each at once . dont jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly ."
5,"keep all of your past work organized and accessible . record all of your artistic contacts and connections in one place . log the costs of supplies needed for each project . find out how much it costs you to make and sell each piece . pay attention to what other , similar works of art are selling for . consider the cost of your time when pricing work .",how to be an organized artist 3,"when you finish a project , whether it sells or not , dont just stuff it away in a drawer . you never know when youll want to revisit and idea or , more excitingly , when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects . if you do electronic work , back it up every 3 - 6 months on a dedicated hard drive . there is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects . more than many industries , successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists , curators , instructors , and gallery assistants to be successful . you never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand , or when youll have some work you want to place in a friends art show . dont leave meetings and connections up to chance - - organize and compile your contact information in once place for later . make notes of phone number email location role in the art world how you met or connected . if youre looking to make a living off art , you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business . this , however , does not need to interfere with your creative process . simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy . you can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes , as they are private business expenses . keeping expenses organized isnt just about time , it is about saving money . if youre making the same or similar pieces each day , you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made . so , if 10 wood sculptures cost you 100 , each sculpture cost you 10 to make 10010  10 . this may seem trivial , but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work . at the very least , ensure that you are not losing money on each piece . if you want an organized , productive artistic practice , you need to know about the trends around your work . keeping organized is about more than just your own studio , it is about understanding the art market youre a part of . peruse etsy , visit galleries and show openings , and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices . while it doesnt have a dollar value , make sure you value your time as well as your materials . in the earlier example , dont forget that it cost more than just 10 to make the sculpture . your hours of work and experience are essential too , so dont sell the piece for 20 if it took you a week to make . while pricing your work is difficult , dont balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for - - not everyone can do what you do , and people are paying for your talent and experience . at the very least , consider what youd be paid if you used your time otherwise . twenty hours spent painting could be worth 15 an hour at another job . you should consider this missed money when pricing work . if you want to make art your living , you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself . careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off ."
6,create a compelling reel or portfolio . land an internship . consider self - employment . sign on with a design company or studio . move up to a supervisor position .,how to be a visual effects artist 2,"this should be a short video showcasing the breadth and depth of your skills as an artist . some choose to follow a storyline format while others cycle through a series of clips . most college programs will give you time to create this work in your junior or senior years using professional grade equipment and software . your reel is also a chance for you to showcase any unique skills that you possess , such as drawing or sculpting . dont be afraid to work with other artists to create your reel . showing that you can collaborate well with others is something that studios often look for when hiring . if you are enrolled in a vfx program , talk to your career counselors to see what opportunities might be available . if you are developing your skills on your own , reach out to studios to see if they have any spots for paid or unpaid interns . this will give a potential employer a chance to get to know you and might make it easier for them to hire you in the future . over half of vfx artists are their own bosses . being a freelance designer gives you more control over your schedule and project selection . but , it also means that you will need to handle administrative tasks and could struggle with bringing in a consistent income . if this path interests you , it would be wise to take a few classes in marketing and accounting . getting established is a hard struggle that many self - employed artists face . choosing your own projects can mean that youll establish a specialty more quickly than you might in a large studio . however , affording the most recent design equipment may be tough , depending on how successful you are . this is a more traditional option where you agree to full or part - time employment with an established company . your work schedule and salary will very much depend on the prominence of the company and the types of projects that come in . however , you may get the opportunity to work on some big hollywood blockbusters or top - rated television showsget your foot in the door of larger companies by serving as a junior 2d artist or runner . a junior artist will assist those with seniority by creating basic outlines for scenery and the like . a runner literally runs sketches and communications between the vfx team and a director , for example . with enough time , effort , and luck , you may get the chance to take on a leadership position for a project . as a supervisor , the final product that audiences see is your responsibility . youll take all of the raw images and make them fit together while working alongside the production team ."
7,join a professional society . enjoy working with a team . expect long work hours . spend time on a tv or film set .,how to be a visual effects artist 3,"networking is a great way to find new opportunities and exchange ideas . start establishing your network as soon as you decide to become a vfx artist . join an industry group , such as the visual effects society ves . if you cant fully join , then simply follow their activities and attend events when you can . the ves has almost 3 , 400 members spread across the entire world . their work ranges from video games to television . most vfx work situations will require that you communicate with a number of people as you complete a task . you may need to talk with directors , other vfx artists , and animators to create a unified vision for the final product . taking communication courses in college is only one way you can learn how to communicate effectively . this also means that you will need to find ways to work with constructive criticism and feedback . altering your final product based on information from the wider production team is often something that you just have to do . for example , a director might ask you to cut down a scene that youve spent weeks working on . pitching your creative vision and ideas to others is also an important part of the process . if you can make a product more memorable in an advertisement , for instance , then the creative team probably wants to know . most vfx artists start work mid - morning and go until the late evening . or , your shift could be an overnight one that ends in the early morning hours . the schedule very much depends on the deadlines that are looming and how the work is divided over time . youll want to be prepared for unpredictable timelines as a vfx artist . partially due to the long hours , many vfx professionals describe their work setting as being pretty laid back in terms of dress and even behavior . if you are considering working in the entertainment industry , try to get out of your office and away from your computer and head to the actual sets . this will give you a chance to see how the production team works together on the ground . pay attention to how each persons job feeds into the final product ."
8,"make sure you know what is expected of you . stick to your topic . dont try to be to be funny unless the scenario calls for it . act naturally for the situation talk , act and sit as your character would usually do in the circumstances . participate . dont react to what others say as yourself , stay in character . dont make anything violent or too crazy . relax and enjoy yourself . be your character . play games that allow you to practice improvisation .",how to be good at improvisation,"some entire movies are improvised , some plays are . sometimes a group gets together to improvise one scene or find ways to improve a scene . sometimes a drama lesson can be a while series of different improvised scenes . a class leader may ask everyone to stand and improvise a moonwalk as an ice breaker . you might be put into small groups and given a set time to put together a scene . improvisation covers a lot make sure you know exactly what you have to be good at . often in improvisation , you will be given a topic or scenario which determines what , where and who you are . stay in character . whoever has decided the scenario , wants to see your interpretation of it , not something completely off topic that you prefer to perform . keep it appropriate . dont introduce the fact you have a super power if you are supposed to be showing how to close a sale or pretend the room is starting to flood when youre meant to be being your interpretation of a clock that needs winding . yes , some amusing words may get a laugh , but dont lose a good story line by trying to be too funny , unless thats your character . if you work with a partner , dont end up in a comedy contest , trying to be better than your partner . focus on your acting not the audience . dont let fear hold you back . it can be scary to stand up in front of a crowd . take a speech class to practice this and help you get over stage fright . if someone in your group says , im the best soccer player ever , dont cut himher off and say , really i thought you were a gymnast because you know thats what they really do . remember the rest of the groups is improvising too . that always ends the show . being energetic is great , in the right situation , but screaming and shouting or running around excessively just isnt always realistic . being nervous can ruin the improvised scene . relaxing and enjoying yourself can make the audience enjoy you . imagine how that character would move , would react , would speak , would think , would feel . show that in your actions . there are a lot of improvisation games that were show cased in the popular tv show whos line is it anyway . research that . or try other options such acting a scene where everyone who speaks has to include a colour in their sentences . or you can start a scene and as soon as the actors are in an opportune position , someone says pause , takes a character out , and starts the scene again at a completely different situations inspired by the position of the actors ."

- you want to blend in , not stand out . invest in several black tops and pants so you will always have a clean supply . a stage manager is a very demanding job , time - wise . you need to have enough time in your schedule to be early to every single event , whether it be a meeting , rehearsal , dress rehearsal , or a performance . youll also need to set up for every event , as well as clean up afterwards . stage managers have a lot of people and things to keep track of . you must remain calm , cool , and collected . however , stand your ground when needed to make sure that things are progressing as they should be . be assertive , but polite to the cast , crew , and guests . express yourself directly and openly . dont be afraid to tell others how you feel , or how you think they are doing in their own roles . give specific examples of ways they can improve , and be sure to praise them when they follow your advice . be firm but still friendly . guests coming to see the production need to be treated well so they have the best possible experience . though you will likely be busy with numerous other things , take guests requests or complaints seriously and do your best to attend to them . for instance , if someone complains about gum on the floor , assure them it will be taken care of immediately , and then get someone from your crew or the house management crew to clean it up if you are in a tight spot . if someone approaches you during a break in the performance and tells you they are unable to hear the dialogue or music , take steps to rectify the situation . adjust the audio for that section of the theatre if others in the area are having similar trouble . you could also offer the person another seat in a different section , if possible . stage managers are in charge of the entire production , so you must be a good leader for this job . youll need to know how to delegate tasks and manage other people . stage managers must be patient , calm , and level - headed , especially when things go wrong . to be a great leader , you need to be an active listener . when someone is speaking with you , give them your undivided attention and make eye contact . dont interrupt or judge them , but do try to understand where they are coming from . great leaders also take responsibility for their actions . own up to any mistakes you make , and realize that as the stage manager you will be responsible for mistakes that other people make as well . make sure someone is able to effectively complete a task before delegating it . youll need to be able to communicate well with a variety of people on the cast and crew . not only will you be in charge of the stage crew , youll also have to communicate with the director , choreographer , and actors . stage managers also schedule meetings and call times , take notes during meetings , and write up rehearsal reports . speak clearly and assertively to everyone you encounter . you should also be specific when making requests to others in order to avoid confusion . body language is also a part of communication . demonstrate friendliness and approachability by using open body language , such as smiling and angling toward people who are speaking . avoid frowning , crossing your arms , and fidgeting . there are many things for a stage manager to take care of and coordinate , so youll need to be organized . keep a notebook for each production to jot down rehearsal and call times , contact info for the cast and crew , blocking notations from the director , etc . pay attention to the details . youll need to keep track of everything from the names of the understudies to the quality of the gel sheets for the stage lights . you can also make to - do lists , set deadlines for tasks , and multitask in order to get everything accomplished on time ."
13,"set up a clear list of traits and characteristics you are looking for , as well as the skills the actors need to have . remember the budget , the deadline , and all of the small details that the person you hire will need to know . call a talent agent , or look through portfolios on their website to see if anyone has the right qualificationsappearance .  leave an advertisement in a high circulation newspaper or on an ad site . use any connections you may have to track down the perfect man or woman for the job , such as an aspiring performer , a casting director , a drama teacher , etc .  use social media sites to contact actors or widen your search area .  search for actors online and contact them through their website .  hold an open call audition . attend plays , concerts , recitals , or even a few acting classes to search for the talent .",how to find actors,"having a vision of the appearance and abilities of the performers can help you to narrow down your search . of course , you dont always have to stick to what youve written down , a lot of people change their mind to suit a different person . mapping out how much time and money you have for your search is crucial , since this will give you an idea of which method you should use . , this is the way to go if you have very specific criteria , or if youre on a low budget . place an advert in the stage or any other appropriate magazine commonly read by actors seeking employment . , this is great if you dont have enough resources andor knowledge for the other methods . just be warned that many hopeful but untalented people will pass through the doors .

15,"define the workshop objective . decide who your audience is . schedule your workshop for the morning or early afternoon . publicize your workshop . recruit 8 - 15 participants for your workshop . prepare your participants for the workshop . prioritize your goals for the workshop . prepare a variety of teaching aids . prepare paper handouts . arrange your audio - visual materials . organize your computer - based materials . recruit experts , speakers , and assistants . decide on your group activities . leave time for breaks . resist cramming . secure catering . arrive early . set up all equipment before participants arrive . arrange the chairs in advance . distribute materials . greet participants as they arrive . introduce yourself and the workshop . begin icebreakers . execute your lesson plan . be flexible . use interactive exercises to reinforce information . dont talk too much . stick to your scheduled breaks . switch up activities every 20 - 30 minutes . lighten the mood . maintain a respectful , democratic atmosphere . be prepared for the unexpected . conclude the workshop with a summary of what they have learned . get feedback immediately after the session . follow up with the participants a few days or weeks later . schedule a follow - up workshop if necessary .",how to conduct a workshop,"whether you are teaching a skill , delivering information or increasing awareness , outline the goals of your workshop . what do you want your workshop participants to learn this analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching , concrete topics you will cover , or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants . think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important . some examples of workshop objectives include learn how to write a persuasive cover letter . learn how to break bad news to a patient . learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class . learn how to create an effective powerpoint presentation . will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop . for example , if your audience already knows each other , you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly . if they are complete strangers , you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions . these are the times when participants are most awake and alert . you want your participants to be fully engaged and aware . if you can , avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient . pass around flyers , hang up posters , or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation . having a catchy title helps , as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessary . be sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch peoples attention . a workshop is not the same as a large lecture . you want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions , practice their skills , and work together . but you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting . ideally a workshop will have 8 - 15 participants . sometimes you dont have a choice about your group size . if you have a very large group , find creative ways to make sure the size doesnt become overwhelming . for example , a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different break - out groups of 8 participants each . you could also bring in co - facilitators and co - presenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal . some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place . perhaps they have to study journal articles , write a short story , or read one anothers work . if your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place , be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning . be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time . be clear about where and how your students should submit their work . will they have to give you hard copies , or will you circulate materials by email most workshops are time - limited . they can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days . but no matter what , you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participants . rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time , think about the most important skills , techniques , and information you want your audience to gain . prioritize those in your lesson plan . adults learn in all kinds of ways visually , orally , through hands - on practice , or any combination of the above . remember that you might not know your participants learning styles ahead of time , so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared . depending on the topic and objective of your workshop , you might want to prepare paper handouts , audio - visual aids , computer - based lesson plans , and role - playing activities . readings , case studies , lists of key terms , and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare . it is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time . that way you can catch typos or errors . be sure to use a large , easy - to - read font . give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future . if you have lengthy readings , consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in prepared . if you are handing out numerous documents , consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized . if you give this workshop often enough , you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees . if you plan to present a slideshow , video clips , or sound clips , you will have to prepare these ahead of time . test them at home to make sure they are working correctly . make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space . it is wise to consult with your venues av technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly . not all projectors are compatible with macintosh computers , for example . and some rooms might not have sound projection . make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use . if your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum , you will need to organize these materials ahead of time . think about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices , and notify them if so . if your participants will be expected to do activities online , be sure to consult with your venues av technician . you will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet , and you might have to ask for the networks password in advance . depending on the topic and size of your workshop , you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning . an expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group . if you require help from anyone , make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time . the more prepared they are , the better your workshop will be . interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning . brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshops objectives . keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs , small groups , or as a full group . make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop . some possible group activities include debates . break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position . think - pair - shares . ask your participants a discussion question . have them think about it on their own , discuss their thoughts with a partner , and then share their conclusions with the full group . question - and - answer sessions . if you have a lot of information to present , include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material . you can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them . role - playing activities . assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning . brainstorming sessions . ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of . write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard . then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with . people are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks . they are also more likely to remember what they have learned . schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5 - minute break per hour of your workshop . this will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable . actual activities can often take 10 - 20 more time than we estimate . if you think a q - and - a session will last 10 minutes , it might very well last 12 minutes or longer . build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover . resist the urge to cram in as much as possible your participants will feel tired and rushed . if you are worried that your workshop will end early , you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning . if you have time for them , great and if not , no harm done . workshops take a lot of work and energy . help keep your participants energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages . ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop . you should not have to pay for snacks out - of - pocket . try to avoid junk foods . unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon . that will leave your participants bored and tired . aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit , vegetables , hummus , and whole grain breads . leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room . you might have to meet with av technicians , caterers , or your team members before your workshop begins as well . give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make last - minute adjustments to your workshop plan . computers , laptops , projectors , and speakers will all have to be fine - tuned in advance . after all , you want your workshop time to be productive you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology . if you can , see if you can have the venues av technician assist you with the set - up . you might not be familiar with the rooms technological capabilities , and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently . the way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group , the size of the room , and the activities you have planned . ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi - circle this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation . if everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo , perhaps a semi - circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate . if you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out , place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop . make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled . other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include snacks and beverages . name - tags and markers . pens and pencils . arriving early allows you to set up , relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop . this helps in building relationships with the participants . once everyone is seated , you will have to orient them to your workshop . be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you . give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it . explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important . it is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared . try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes . even if your topic is a serious one , consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another . explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them . for example , you can ask people to fill out name - tags , grab a cup of coffee , and make sure they have their handouts . if you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away , you can tell them when those materials will be needed . ask your participants to introduce themselves . limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions , such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop . you dont want the icebreakers to go on forever , but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group . you can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a light - hearted question like what is your favorite movie or what is your favorite bad song this is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action . have your outline in front of you , and try to stick to the outline if you can . feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why . your lesson plan doesnt have to be a surprise , and your participants might appreciate being told why youve organized the workshop in the way that you did . for example , you might tell them first we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances . after that , we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem . were going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program . after i explain these terms , well take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page . after that , we will open things up for discussion . please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you . in a few minutes , you will role - play a counselor - student interaction with your partner . it is good to have a plan for your workshop , but be prepared to alter your workshops content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants . build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions , concerns , and interests . you can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on . this will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content . always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity . interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problem - solving techniques . a workshop is not the same thing as a lecture , and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants . let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them . for example , you can deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions . divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group . show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions . provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to role - play the scenario . have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique . you do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop . your participants might get bored or annoyed . keep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting it is a format that thrives on interaction , activity , and group work . scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect . let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks . this allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage , phone calls and other personal needs . do not skip breaks , even if you are running short on time . attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity . view this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem . change up your activities , ask your participants to rearrange their chairs , or schedule a break at least once every 20 - 30 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated . even if you are treating a serious topic , humor can be a great way to emphasize information and keep everyone attentive . think about ways that you can introduce humor in a responsible , ethical way into your presentations , discussions , and activities . this will also encourage your participants to remain relaxed , alert , and comfortable . make sure that all of your workshop participants are treated equally and respectfully . this means that any leadership roles such as group discussion leader should be distributed evenly across the workshop . encourage quiet , shy participants to speak . you want everyone to feel heard and respected . similarly , you do not want a single participants voice or your own voice for that matter to dominate the discussion . most workshops will run smoothly . after all , the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn . however , there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague . be professional no matter what , and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behavior . be clear in what you expect from your participants . if you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague , consider speaking privately with that person . emphasize the importance of what you are teaching , and tell them that you expect adult , professional behavior from them . explain everything that your participants have learned over the course of the session . this will help emphasize how far they have come and what new skills they have acquired . refer explicitly to the objectives you laid out at the beginning of the workshop , and explain how you think the participants have met those objectives . congratulate your workshop for their hard work and for their new knowledge . design an evaluation form that your participants can fill out in the last few minutes of the workshop . be sure that you leave them with enough time to comment and consider your questions carefully . immediate feedback not only will help you improve your workshop but will also help reinforce the learning your participants have undertaken . good questions to ask include what is the stated objective of this workshop did the workshop meet its stated objective what activities helped your learning the most the least was the workshop an appropriate length what workshop materials handouts , readings , quizzes , etc . were the most useful which ones were the least useful how have you learned or grown from this workshop how do you think your colleagues have learned or grown how would you change this workshop in the future any suggestions for improvements are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input . some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences . following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights . you can ask additional questions such as how well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop how has the workshop helped you at work were there ways it could have helped you more what materials have you found useful since the workshop what materials have you thrown away or forgotten about if enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop , consider scheduling a part 2 . in the follow - up workshop , you can address more of their questions , dig more deeply into the topic , or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in part 1 . be sure that your follow - up workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for more advanced attendees ."

syncope , that you may experience immediately before fainting . most fainting spells occur when you are standing , and recognizing warning signs will help you prepare yourself if you do indeed faint . in addition , awareness can also help to prevent a fainting episode and will help you stay safe if you do faint . common symptoms include yawning , a sudden sweat , nausea sickness , fast and deep breathing , confusion , lightheadedness , blurred vision or spots in front of your eyes , and ringing in your ears . the symptoms of fainting can come on very quickly and with little warning . if you experience the above symptoms it is a good idea to conduct antigravity measures , which when done immediately upon feeling symptoms , can help you avoid a fainting episode . medical experts suggest that you lie or sit down and place your head between your knees . these positions will help restore blood flow to the brain and can prevent a fainting episode . if standing , you can also cross your legs and tightening your abdominal muscles . this is effective if you are in a crowded place and you are unable to lie down immediately . , by preparing , you can ensure that you are in a safe and secure place when you faint . try telling someone near you what is happening and ask for assistance , try lying down , or try bracing yourself against a wall to prepare . if you find yourself on stairs or other precarious surroundings , sit down and hold on to a railing immediately . if you do faint , blood flow will resume to your brain naturally and you should regain consciousness in two minutes or less . it is normal to feel weak and confused for 20 to 30 minutes after fainting . remain calm when you regain consciousness . also , take some time to lay on your back to allow blood flow back to the brain . you should also hydrate yourself with water . , fainting spells are not necessarily an indication of a serious medical condition . in fact , fainting spells may be caused by anxiety , fear , pain , emotional stress , hunger , dehydration , surprise , overexertion , clenching , spasms , choking , or drug and alcohol use . if you suspect that your fainting spells are being caused by one of these issues , there are measures you can take to prevent future episodes . hydration is the best way to prevent fainting spells without medication . drinking more water is ideal , but you can get fluids from food sources like watermelon , milk , soups , etc . all caffeinated beverages , including sodas , should be eliminated . if you are sufficiently hydrated , you will be urinating regularly and your urine will be clear or light colored , not dark . caffeine stimulates the heart , making fainting spells more likely to occur . if you drink large amounts of caffeine , you should cut back slowly to avoid headaches . while the amount of fluids you need each day depends on a number of factors â€” including your level of activity , your climate , your overall health and whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding , you should drink about half of your weight in ounces each day . so if you weigh 200 lbs . then you should be consuming 100 oz or 12 . 5 8 - oz glasses of fluids each day . if you are an athlete with more muscle - mass , you should drink about two - thirds of your weight in ounces . eating regularly can also help to reduce lightheadedness and reduce your chance of fainting by boosting blood sugar . if anxiety and stress are causing fainting spells , calming techniques can help you avoid fainting spells . you can try counting your breaths or deep breathing , flexing and relaxing different muscle groups , and paying attention to the immediate moment rather than the past or future also known as mindfulness . avoid placing yourself in stressful situations and do your best to remove yourself from such situations . learning to stay calm and to assert yourself can help you to overcome feelings of anxiety . the flushed look that many people get when they drink alcohol is actually blood rushing to the surface of the skin . this takes blood away from the brain , and can cause fainting episodes . excessive drinking also causes dehydration , which is a leading cause of fainting spells . illegal drugs , particularly stimulants such as cocaine or ecstasy , also cause fainting spells . these should be avoided . while it is possible that fainting spells are not related to medical conditions , it is also possible that they are a sign of a medical problem . to determine this , you will need to visit your doctor . you should see your doctor immediately if you experience fainting while exercising , if fainting occurs with rapid heartbeat , or if your family has a history of fainting . if you experience repeated fainting spells , you should consult your doctor . , your doctor will ask a number of questions to determine the cause of your fainting . these may include the situation you find yourself in when you faint , how long the episodes last , how quickly it takes you to return to normal , and any other symptoms you may experience during the episodes . the doctor may also order a number of tests to determine the cause of your fainting spells . an electrocardiogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects a heart condition is the cause . an electroencephalogram will be ordered if the doctor suspects something in the brain is the cause . , there is a chance that your doctor will not recommend any medication for your fainting spells . there is no medicine that treats fainting spells themselves , so your doctor may instead prescribe a medicine to treat the cause of the fainting spells . these may include medicine for low blood sugar , seizures , anemia , or low blood pressure . if any medications are prescribed , be sure to take them exactly as your doctor advises ."

skinned people . cracks , wrinkles , swelling , shiny areas , blisters , and dry areas are also indicators of bed sores . talk to a nurse if you start noticing these signs . when laying in bed regularly , liquids can build up in the lungs , leading to congestion and even pneumonia . the best way to combat this problem is to make sure your parent is rotated to a new position regularly , preferably every 2 hours . the emotional side of a illness can be just as destructive as the physical side . when your parent becomes bedridden , they cant do the things they used to or visit with the people they enjoyed seeing regularly . encourage people to come over and visit with your parent , so they have regular interaction . also , try to encourage your parent to still participate in activities they enjoy as much as possible . for instance , if your parent enjoys making art , get them a small set of art supplies they can use in bed with a table . its also important to provide a safe place where your parent can talk about whats going on . they need a sounding board as much as you do . you can be this person some of the time , but make sure that your parent feels comfortable talking with other people as well . if you are their only source of support , then this can put a lot of pressure on you when you already have so much going on . often , a person who is bedridden will qualify for having a social worker assist with their needs . a social worker can benefit you , too , as they can help you find the care you need for your parent , as well as other resources . most hospitals have social services on site , though you can also visit a medicaremedicaid office in your local community , or visit the offices of an insurance company that that your parent goes through . when your parent is sick , you may feel like youre alone in the situation . however , more often than not , friends and family would like to help you , but they dont know how . take the time to meet with friends and family members one at time to ask for help . it is important to be assertive when asking for help from friends and family . try saying , im creating a weekly schedule for moms care . please let me know which two days you would like this week . offer a specific task if they dont seem to know how to help . if you have children , then you might also consider asking a friend or family member to watch them for you one evening per week while you care for your parent . be sure to let your children know why you need someone to watch them during these times . if your parent has become bedridden , its likely youll need some help from professional caregivers . if youre caring for the person at home , you can get help from people who come to the house . if the person will need long - term care , you may need to consider placing them in a facility that can provide care . if your parent has a terminal illness , hospice care may provide some relief . both in - home care and care facilities can be expensive . insurance and medicare may cover some in - home care which sometimes includes in - home care at senior facilities . have a talk with your parent about getting some help . they may not like the idea much , as some people are reluctant to have outside help . if you need help persuading them , try asking someone whos been in a similar situation to help . it might also be hard for your parent to hear this from you . you might consider asking someone who has a different relationship with your parent to talk with them instead , such as a close friend , a cousin , or a spiritual leader . you can hire whatever level of care you need . for instance , some non - medical care can help with basics like bathroom assistance and meals . however , if your parent needs medical care , you will need to hire nurses or nursing aids to help , though that kind of care is generally prescribed by a doctor . when your parent is bedridden , you likely will have a surplus of emotions , which is perfectly normal . you may find you feel anger or resentment . you might feel guilty that you cant spend more time with them or that theyre bedridden and youre not . you also may feel anxiety about the situation . grief is also common , as youve lost who your parent was . let yourself feel those emotions . acknowledge them , and give yourself permission to feel them . also , make sure you find someone to talk to . anyone with a sympathetic ear will do . writing down your feelings is also a good way to get them out and understand them better . try keeping a journal as well . you can also talk with others who are facing the same issue . you can join a local support group or find one online . in fact , if your parent is on hospice , many hospice organizations have grief support groups available for people in your situation . just knowing youre not alone can help . professional counseling can also be beneficial . if your parent is bedridden , particularly if they have a terminal illness , it can be difficult to come to terms with that , especially if you have a complicated relationship with your parent . a professional can help you work through those feelings and come to terms with whats happening . when it comes to a parents failing health , you may find that having specific answers can somehow make the diagnosis more manageable . when you have questions about your parents health , ask the doctors and nurses . if you dont understand their answer , ask them to explain it in laypersons terms . you deserve to know whats going on with your parents consent , of course . taking notes or having another person there to help you remember everything during conversations with doctors and nurses can also be helpful . emotions may be high , which might make it hard for you to remember everything . take time to do things you normally do for your spiritual self , such as praying or meditating . these activities can have a calming effect in a stressful situation . of course , not everyone considers themselves a spiritual person , and that may be the case with you . nonetheless , it can still help to take a few minutes each day to just be or sit in silence . when youre taking care of a parent , it can be difficult to find time for yourself to do things you enjoy . however , its very important to take time each day to relax if you can . it can be something seemingly insignificant , like drawing a little picture or watching the birds outside . whatever it is , take some time each day to do something you enjoy . similarly , its important to maintain the relationships in your life . try to get away to spend time with people you care about , so you can just be you for a while . at the very least , set aside some time each day to return calls , respond to text messages , or check in with your other loved ones . also , take time to escape . that is , sometimes , escaping into the fantasy world of a book , movie , or television show can give you the mental break you need . you can even enjoy these with your parent . listening to your favorite music can also help you take a break . be sure to schedule this time in . dont wait until you feel like you need a break . when youre providing care , you need to make sure you know what your limits are . determine how much time you can actually give , as well as how much physical care you can give . be firm with those limits , and get help as needed . for example , it is important to maintain your relationship with your spousepartner and children if you have them . this might mean that certain times of the day will be set aside for spending time with your family , such as dinner time . when youre caring for someone , it can be easy to neglect your physical health , but its important to make that a priority , too . make sure youre eating enough and that youre eating healthy meals with lean protein , whole grains , fruits , and veggies . try to get some exercise in when you can , as it will lower your stress level and keep you healthy . in addition , make getting enough sleep a priority . even if you can get enough sleep all at at once , try to work in 7 to 9 hours a day to make sure youll be able to function . finally , make sure you are keeping up your regular doctors appointments and dental care , so that you stay healthy ."

supervision of your parents . if you have a dog , you can also make sure your pet gets a bath once a week and stays clean . you may help your parents bathe your pet or bathe your pet yourself . make sure you use the right techniques to bath your pet . do not try to bath other pets like a rabbit , a bird , a hamster or a cat . these animals can self clean themselves and do not need regular baths .

to walk them on a daily basis , especially if your dog is medium to large in size . you should create a walking schedule with your parents and assist your parents in walking your pet . you may put the collar or harness on the dog and take a turn holding the leash during the walk , with the supervision of a parent . if your dog is a puppy , you should only walk him a five to ten minutes a day . ask your parents about how often you can walk your new puppy and follow their directions . if you have other pets , like a cat , a bird , a hamster , or a rabbit , you may not need to walk them . instead , you should spend time playing with these pets so they still get some exercise . you should spend at least ten to fifteen minutes a day playing with your pet so they feel loved and acknowledged by

is not confused about the rules and is not encouraged to behave badly . if you are unclear about the house rules for your pet , you can ask your parents to write them down for you and post them in an accessible area , such as on the fridge or by the front door . you can then refer to the rules if you are not sure if your pet is allowed to do certain things in your house . you should always let your parents deal with your pet when he behaves badly as you do not want to be aggressive with your pet on your own . your pet may get annoyed and you are at a greater risk of injury than your parents if this happens . instead , you should let your parents know when your pet is acting out or behaving badly and allow them to address it properly . as you get older , your parents may teach you how to address your pets bad behavior in a positive and helpful way . you may notice that your pet seems ill and is displaying signs of a sickness or a health issue . let your parents know right away if you notice anything , as they can then take your pet to the vet and get your pet examined . it is important that you keep an eye on your pet and pay attention to your pet often , as this will ensure you notice any health issues before they become a larger problem . you may also discuss the symptoms of common illnesses with your parents so you know which signs to watch out for in your pet . as you grow up , your pet ownership duties may change . your parents may feel you are mature enough to help them do other pet chores and tasks . you should try to take good care of your pet now so your parents feel they can trust you with more pet responsibilities in the future . children over the age of 10 can usually assume many of the basic responsibilities of caring for a pet . your parents may

27,assess your pets needs . adjust your pets schedule . write detailed instructions . talk to your veterinarian .,how to leave your pets alone while on vacation 1,"all pets are different and have unique personalities . some do well when left alone for longer periods of time and others do not . pets that are more social , have medical conditions , or that are used to having lots of interaction with others may not do as well on their own for long periods of time . also consider your pets feeding schedule or if your pet likes to get into things and make a mess when you are not around . younger pets may not be able to handle being left alone as well as more mature pets . if your animal has separation anxiety , a pet - sitter or a boarding house may be a good option . two weeks before your vacation , start leaving your pet home alone for longer periods of time . if you usually leave your pet at home while you are away at work , leave your house for a couple of hours after work each day . if you usually see your pet during the day , leave your pet at home while you are at work . this will prepare your pet to spend more time alone . if you are leaving your pet in someone elses care , it is important that you give him or her enough information to care for your pet . leave your contact information , the phone number of your veterinarian in case of an emergency . if your pet has any special dietary needs or likes specific treats or toys , write this information down . include information about your pets routine , bathroom habits , schedule , and any medications . also include any information about your pets personality that someone may need to know . does your pet get excited when someone is at the door does your pet have a favorite hiding place be as detailed as possible when writing down the instructions . it is better to give someone too much information than not enough . it is important that your pet is up - to - date on vaccinations and is healthy before you leave for vacation . this is also the time to ask about the best options for leaving your pet when you are gone . your veterinarian may have recommendations for pet sitters and boarding options . leaving your pet in a safe and trusted place will keep you from worrying while you are gone ."
28,greet your pets . take special time each day to interact with your pets . wipeclean up accidents . give your pets a safe place to travel .,how to keep your pets happy,"even if you have a busy schedule and return home late , make sure to call out to your pets . if you have a dog , he will probably be all over you within seconds of your arrival unless hes busy trying to dig out a bone from his favourite hidden place , your couch . calling out to your pets generates a positive attitude towards them and they feel less threatened . if you have a lot of pets , call out their names one after the other . kittens usually do not respond if they are asleep , so you might need to respect that but they will scurry towards you if they suspect cat treats in the grocery bags you just bought in . remind them that they were missed . even 20 minutes will help them feel taken care of . for more active pets , a walk might be a good idea if your cat has peed on your favourite luggage bag , wipe it clean . there is nothing much you can do about it , except try to take away the pungent smell from the luggage , beds or linen they tend to soil . the very best and most effective cleanser would be bicarbonate soda andor a little white vinegar . you can try a solution of a little detergent mixed with bicarbonate soda a few drops of bleach , a tablespoon of vinegar , 5 drops of dettol , 2 tablespoons of bicarbonate soda and oodles of water . cats cannot be screamed at , because they simply wont understand . they will know that you are angry for some reason and rubbing their snouts on the soiled area can repeat their behaviour . carry your cats or kittens to the litter tray and be gentle with them . soon they will learn . dogs love to travel , but only if they get to ride shot - gun , so invest in a proper and spacey carrier box . kittens like to sneak into dark corners within the car and this can be pretty hazardous if your kittens slip towards the food pedestals . beware , invest in spacey and cosy carrier box ."
29,"consider time spent caring for your pets . calculate space requirements for your pets . make sure you have the ability to care for your pets . count the number of pets you already have . create a budget . consider what you could spend your money on without pets . make sure all your needs are being met . pay for medical care . find out what the rules are . check city , county , and state laws . make sure all pets are licensed . consider any children in the house . be courteous of others . be aware of pet hoarding . find a new home for excess pets . volunteer or give money to support animal rescue groups or shelters .",how to know when you have too many pets,"cleaning , feeding , grooming , exercising , and ensuring a supply of fresh water is available for your animals takes time . see how long it takes you each day to properly care for all the animals you own . compare this with the amount of free time you have available after other obligations are met , such as work , school , family time , etc . make sure you wont be neglecting another area of your life to care for all your animals . always remember to take care of your pets . if you dont have time to take care of them all or dont remember which ones you have taken care of that day , you may have to get rid of some of them . some animal types will require different maintenance . a long - haired dog , for example , probably needs to be brushed daily , while a cat can groom himself . bird and hamster cages need to be cleaned out and disinfected often , with soiled bedding removed regularly . be sure to consider the total amount of time you spend on all caretaking tasks for each animal you own each day , week , and month . the amount of free time you have available and are willing to spend caring for pets will determine how much time you spend with them . however , if it takes over two to three hours to take care of all your animals every day , then you may already have too many pets . consider what your living arrangements are â€”how large is the living area and yard space you have for your animals if you live in a small upstairs apartment without a yard , then take that into account when thinking about how many animals you can house . if you live out in the country on several acres , then you can probably keep more animals . remember that each animal needs to have enough room to walk around and not be in a cramped space . while space definitely needs to be considered so that everyone can live together comfortably , time is the more important factor here . if you have the time to walk your dogs , then providing a large area to run in is not as important as making sure you can take them for walks every day to meet their exercise needs . your health status is an important factor to consider when getting more pets . be aware of what you can and cannot handle without assistance . if you have difficulty getting around on your own , another pet may not be the best idea . also , consider your mental health status . depression can make it very difficult to care for yourself as well as pets . your animals rely on you , so not taking on more than you can handle is very important for everyones wellbeing . animals can cause stress and contribute to mental health problems , such as anxiety . you are responsible for your pets . the more animals you have , the more their needs , health issues and behavior can weigh on you . though the number of pets you have can give you an idea of whether you already have a lot , the resources that you have available are more important than the actual number of animals you own . you need to be able to care for and provide an enriching environment for all your animals so that they can be happy and bring you joy as companions instead of more life stress . consider what species of animals you have as well as individual temperaments and group sexual dynamics before getting another pet . overcrowding may have a negative effect on the pets you already have . for example , its recognized that in household with five cats or more there is a high likelihood of inappropriate spraying in order to mark territory . this is because the cats view the presence of other cats as a threat . the more cats , the bigger the perceived threat . so consider whether or not its fair to take on another pet if it adds to the stress of your existing pets . if you cant count all your pets , or lose count , you have too many pets and shouldnt get any more . while some people may look down on a person with 10 cats , as long as the owner can provide a sanitary place to live , afford medical care and emergency services for each cat as well as meet their own needs and pay bills , then there isnt a problem . the pack mentality can increase as you get more dogs , and this can cause more behavioral problems because the social dynamics become more complex and your ability to give attention to each animal is lessened . mixing male and female animals can increase competition . hormones , territorial tendencies , and breeding behavior all contribute to problems you will have to deal with . keep this in mind before adding new pets to the ones you already have . write down your expected expenses and income for the month . use bank statements , receipts , and bills to help determine what youre spending every month . include your house or rent payment , car payments , insurance , groceries , gas , utilities , and other spending . be sure to include all the expenses related to your pets , such as food , grooming , toys , bedding , supplies , medications , and healthcare costs . doing this will allow you to see how much you are spending on your pets every month . consider how adding another pet will change these numbers . is it something you still want to do looking at the numbers , what could you afford if you didnt have so many pets look at yearling savings as well as monthly . this can really show you whether another pet is worth it or not . if you didnt have pets , could you increase your entertainment costs or pay for a car could you take that trip youve been wanting to take now , think about the monthly and yearly costs associated with getting another pet . what will you have to cut out of your budget and lose dont skip meals to pay for your cats litter . make sure you get the nutrition you need and can pay your bills on time . if youre regularly making late rent payments or not going to the doctor so you can buy your dogs food , then you probably dont need another pet . medical care for animals can be expensive â€” sometimes thousands of dollars a visit . youll want to be able to save up money regularly in case you need to pay for emergency care or buy prescription medications for your animals . you need to be financially prepared for each animal that you own . keep up to date with shots . many young animals need a series of vaccinations the first year and regular rabies vaccinations after that . if you have multiple animals , pet insurance may be a good option . be sure you can make your payments every month and pay any remaining balances for each pet . your apartment or neighborhood may have rules that dictate the size , breed , and number of animals you can have . check your lease , talk to your landlord or your neighborhood association to find out if there is a limit to how many animals you can keep on your property . your local animal control and zoning laws probably dictate how many animals you can keep on your property . governing bodies do this in order to prevent unsanitary , unhealthy conditions for residents . you will want to call animal control or talk to your city or county administrative office to find out what the local laws are so you can remain in compliance . pet hoarding , or having too many pets than you can take care of , is likely in violation of your state , city , county , or other local health and zoning laws . you could lose your pets and even your house . many cities and counties require animals to be registered and licensed . in order to license pets , the pet often has to be spayed or neutered or a breeder license purchased and all shots be up to date . you can be fined or jailed if you do not have all your pets legally licensed . because you are responsible for your pets and your children , having too many pets can compromise your ability to care for your children . if you cant keep your property and home clean or neglect your animals , you can be charged with child neglect or endangerment as well . make sure your children are taken care of before you consider getting anymore pets . the more animals you have , the more odors and noise they create . dont get so many pets that your neighbors start complaining . the size of your residence will play a factor in this as well â€” an apartment is going to be right next to another apartment , whereas you probably have some space between houses . many apartments and cities have noise ordinances . check with yours to make sure that adding another barking dog wont be a problem . some people have a mental illness that causes them to have more than the typical number of pets . they are unable to meet minimal care requirements and cannot recognize that they have a problem â€” even when animals become ill or die . you will need to contact your local police or health department or humane society if you or someone you know suffers from this condition . the unsanitary conditions of pet hoarding also negatively affect the community by increasing the risk of fire , creating poor air quality , attracting pests , and encouraging the transmission of infectious diseases . it is in your best interest to report suspected pet hoarding cases . when animals do not have access to enough food , live in unhygienic conditions or dont get medical care , its considered to be animal cruelty . if you suspect you may be a pet hoarder , seek professional help right away . if you find that you cant support the pets you have or take care of them , then you need to give up some of them . you and your animals all deserve to have a good quality of life . if you can no longer give them the attention , time , space , or provide the food or medical care that they need , you must allow them a chance to get the care they deserve with someone else . friends , family members , and co - workers might be able to take one off your hands . if not , there are many rescue groups , shelters , and animal sanctuaries that can help . put an add up in your local paper , at a local pet shop , feed store , or on an online site like craigslist . com for the animals you need to give up . if you can no longer take care of extra animals , you can still help out in other ways . support documented 501c3 corporations with a reputation for providing high - quality animal care however you can . your local shelter can always use your help as well ."

depth research about care for your pet .,how to take care of your pet,"while pets are loving additions to your home , they are not always easy to manage . all pets require time , money , and love in addition to the specific needs of each animal and breed . you need to be sure you want a pet not just that day but in the long - term . most pets require attention and maintenance during the day , so make sure youll be home enough to take care of your pet . if you have kids , consider what pets will be kid friendly . hamsters and fish , for example , make great early pets . if you plan on moving or making large lifestyle changes you shouldnt consider a pet until you are more stable . even different types of dogs have different needs , so make sure you pick a pet that suits your means . before buying a pet do thorough research on the behaviors and needs of various pets you like . dont go into this decision dead - set on one species or breed - - being open - minded can lead to happy surprises and the right pet for your family . keep in mind some general concerns with different pets dogs - though dogs vary widely by breed , all dogs need lots of attention , time to exercise , and plenty of room to roam . cats - intelligent and individual , cats will be fine with less supervision , though they still need your love and time to keep from acting out . hamsters , gerbils , ferrets , and rodents - economical and short - living , rodents make good first pets . they often , however , have strong odors . fish - fish need careful monitoring and care to thrive , and wont cuddle anytime soon . think of having a fish like having a garden . lizards - happy on their own and generally easy to care for , lizards do not offer much affection and can be difficult to diagnose when sick . birds - birds can be incredibly messy and are often loud . they are also expensive and occasionally temperamental , especially bigger birds like parrots . curious , food - driven , and unable to listen to your warnings , pets can get into trouble if you dont create boundaries or safe spaces . birds may dart out of open windows , lizards can scamper around the house , and dogs or cats may run into the street . take note of openings your pet could accidentally escape through and make sure you can keep food out of their reach . remove any harmful objects like knives or poisonous food . if you want your animal to have outside time , consider putting in a fence . put aside one room that you can designate as the pets bedroom . aim to adopt your pet during a relatively quiet time in your life so that everyone can avoid undue stress while getting used to each other . talk to the pet store attendants or adoption agencies about things youll need - - housing , toys , grooming supplies , etc . - - and shop before you bring your new pet home . teach your family members how to use everything so that everyone is on the same page . if you have young children you can help them prepare for pet care by feeding a doll or regularly watering plants . pets are not ultra expensive , but that doesnt mean you wont need to spend money . below are some annual cost estimates provided by the aspca dogs - - 600 - 900 , depending on size cats - - 600 rabbit - - 700 rodents - - 300 - 650 , depending on size fish - - 40 small birds - - 400 large birds parrots , macaws - - 700 - 1 , 200 set aside a few hundred dollars in case of emergency veterinary costs . be sure to bring your pet to the vet soon after adopting it as well . just like humans , pets need regular check - ups to spot problems before they become serious conditions . use your first visit to discuss how often you should schedule check - ups and your pets dietary and medical needs . be sure to schedule shots and vaccinations as soon as you can . ask your vet what symptoms to look for if your pet gets sick . spay or neuter dogs and cats to prevent pet over - population . record your vets number as well as the number of a veterinary hospital in case of emergencies . the cheapest food you find may not always be the healthiest . feeding animals table scraps - no matter how cute they are when they beg - is not a good idea since people food often has minerals and items in it that can be harmful to our animal friends . only feed your pet appropriate foods and give them responsible portions . research or ask your vet about good food sources and portion sizes . natural foods , though more expensive , are healthier than dry or processed foods . , though this is certainly true of dogs and cats , even fish and lizards require dedication and love to really thrive . animals are social beings much like humans , and you need to set aside time to play with your pets so they get exercise and mental stimulation . give your pet room to roam - - the bigger the animal , the more room theyll need . buy toys and play - sets for you and your pet to use together . give your pet the occasional treat after good behavior to motivate it and cement good habits . this will keep both you and your pet healthy and happy . create a regular cleaning schedule , at least once every 2 - 3 weeks , and stick to it , cleaning your animal and its living spaces to prevent disease and odor . for larger pets like cats and dogs , there are animal cleaning centers with large tubs and hoses . keep up with regular grooming , such as brushing fur or scrubbing scales , every few days . for dogs and cats , make sure you keep their nails short so they dont break painfully . , while these steps are general guidelines for pet ownership , each animal is different and you need to adapt accordingly . ask friends who have similar pets , check out books from the library , and search internet discussion boards about your breed or species . you can never know too much . be flexible once you bring your pet home . pets have personalities and will have different wants and needs ."
32,"research the type of pet , so you can make sure the pet fits into your environment and lifestyle . choose your breed carefully , especially if you have children . be realistic about your budget , and your ability to shoulder responsibilities . exercise your pet if its the kind of pet that needs it , such as a dog . watch your pets diet carefully . consider whether your pet needs to be groomed . monitor your pet for illness and injury . train your pet if its the kind of pet that needs it . make time for your pet . love your pet .",how to take care of a pet,"it is critical that you do adequate research before buying the pet . different animals have different needs regarding care for example , tropical fish cannot be treated the same way as cold water fish , and even within the same species , different breeds can have different needs . if you are buying a dog , then buying a high energy , large breed such as a wolfhound would be unsuitable if you live in a small apartment or spend all day at work and have nowhere to let the dog roam in the day . focus on the pets needs , not your wants . if you want an animal like a snake instead , research is still important . it is critical that the snake has enough space to crawl around in and a heat source such as a lightbulb . if youre leading an active life , choose a dog . if you are away from home a lot , though , choose a cat or some other free - roaming animal . if you just want an animal to look at and dont want to interact with it directly , or dont have lots of time , choose a fish or a snake , or other creepy - crawlies . its a mistake to just decide i want a dog or any other animal and to buy the animal without considering the needs and requirements of the breed . some breeds are natural shepherds , which makes them great for 1 person , but some breeds border collie , for example have the sheep - herding instinct in their blood . this means that when a child roams too far from the rest of the herd , the collie will try to get it back . how does it do it with the sheep it bites them . this may result in grave injuries to children . please do your research on how breeds behave . it is important that a pet lives in an environment where it will be comfortable , safe and provided with what it needs . some animals are very adaptable , such as cats , which can live happily in environments ranging from farm land to city centers , while others have more specific needs . for example , horses must have a lot of pastureland and somewhere safe to shelter . for animals that will roam the house , not being confined to tanks or cages , they will need places to sleep that are out of the way of general household traffic , where they can lie without being disturbed , such as the corner of a room . if they are a cat that will often be shut indoors , then it is also important that they have a litter tray that is regularly cleaned out . some pets are more expensive than other pets , and you need to be honest with yourself about whether you can afford the pet - and whether you have the time and maturity to handle it . costs associated with pets include set - up supplies . depending on the kind of pet , you might need a crate , an aquarium , and leashes . dont forget the ongoing costs of caring for a pet . you need to factor in the cost of regular food purchases , but also whether you can afford to take your pet to the veterinarian for preventative care like shots , not just emergency care . thats essential to keep the pet healthy , and it can be quite costly . figure out the exercise needs if any of the pet before you buy it , and consider whether your lifestyle gives you enough time to meet them . some pets dont require you to do much beyond providing them with a safe place to move about , such as buying a run for a rabbit , and making sure the tank is large enough for fish . but other pets must be exercised . dogs require a more hands - on approach to exercise because they need to be walked regularly . making sure your pet gets enough exercise can help prevent aggression and destructive behaviors . many foods that are edible for humans can be inappropriate for animals , making them ill when they consume them , so it is important to research what foods your pet can not eat as well as those they can eat . overfeeding is as harmful as underfeeding , so it is important that your pet gets the amount of food it needs and not too much extra . for some animals , dietary requirements may change with the season for example , if you have horses or other grazing animals , they will often require more hay during the seasons when there is less grass . look at pet food labels to make sure you are purchasing food for your pet that is properly nutritious . research which food could harm your pet . it is vital that all pets have a constant water supply . check water bowls at least once a day to ensure that they have enough water and that the water is clean and not contaminated . many animals will largely take care of themselves , only really needing to be groomed or bathed when they manage to get very messy . others , such as long - haired dogs or cats , may need regular grooming . it is a good idea to desensitize your pet to being groomed or bathed from an early age . when brushing fur , ensure any brush used on the face is soft , and if brushing long , tangled fur , take the time to work out knots gently rather than tugging . you can buy brushes for pets at pet stores . when bathing your pet , make sure that the water is lukewarm and that the products you use do not cause an allergic reaction - buying specialist shampoos is not always necessary , but heavily perfumed products may cause a rash for many animals . consider taking your pet to a professional groomer if you arent sure you are competent to do it . you dont want to accidentally injure the pet . as pets cannot tell us when they are ill or injured , it is up to us to keep an eye on them and look out for any signs of injury . knowing your pets normal behavior is very important if they are sick or injured , they will often act unusually , such as sleeping more , going off their food , etc . if they begin to act oddly , check them for any injuries and keep an eye on their food and water intake if they stop eating or drinking , or they have obvious wounds that are concerning you , then take them to the vet . make sure that your pet has all of the proper vaccines and other preventative medication suggested by your veterinarian , such as heart worm pills for some dogs . a major part of caring for a pet is training . training is essential for the safety of the animal and the people who interact with it . if you have an apartment cat , the litter box is very important from the start . you have to teach your cat to use the litter box and to think of it as its only place to do the necessary business . the litter box needs frequent cleaning once or twice a day , depending on the cat . feeding is approximately 2 or 3 times a day , again , depending on the cat . water should be supplied continuously . dogs need to be trained so they understand proper behavior , such as where to go to the bathroom and not to jump on people when they enter the house . its important that the owner establishes control , but never in an abusive or harmful way to the animal . some animals require more attention than others , so the amount of time they need is often relative . just be sure than you are capable of fulfilling whatever that need may be . try to take a little time out of each day to spend with your pet , even if its just sitting down with them . more often than not , your pet would be more than happy to relax with you . dogs should be walked , and hamsters need time to run around in their balls . play should be fun for both your pet and you , but make sure it is safe and monitored at all times . research whether your pet breed needs to socialize with other animals . play with it - dogs are very social animals so they need to spend time with their owners . with toys or simply chasing him around is enough for exercising . dogs have a natural craving for chewing things , so buy a chewing toy to keep him entertained . love is what your relationship with your pet has to be about . show him or her your affection by petting and playing . your pet will be a member of your family , so treat it like one . a good cuddle will do the both of you good . pets respond to the tone of peoples voices as well as touch . horses need attention . like wild horses , if you dont love them properly , they pretty much turn into mustang . give them a treat once in a while , take a walk with them , or ride them for fun . train a pet with positive reinforcement , never cruelty or abuse . keep your pet and its environment clean . if you have a small animal , clean their cage weekly . youre not showing your pet love if you let it sit in filth . if you have a dog , vacuum fur regularly from the house and wash their dog bed from time to time . neglecting to clean your pet could result in infection , so keep on top of its cleanliness"

38,"create a proper training environment . be prepared . start early , train often , but dont push too hard . have it eating out of your hand . shape the desired behaviors . get your clicks . stay on target . employ the step up as an early training step . test the most basic method . use an alternate treat - based step - up . move on to the target - training step - up . dont presume your parrot will or wont talk . watch your mouth . start young and stay calm . repeat , and repeat again .",how to train a parrot,"think about how you would want to teach a small child . if they feel safe , calm , comfortable , and alert , they are more likely to take instruction effectively . the same is true for your parrot . find a quiet space where you and your avian student can focus on the task at hand . choose somewhere familiar to the bird so it will already have a level of comfort before training starts . dont try to train when the parrot is overly agitated . wait for a calmer moment . however , training with treats works best when the bird is hungry , so training before mealtime is usually the best scenario . while parrots are often quite friendly and caring , they are not in general known for being overly patient . delays and mistakes during training sessions may not go over well , so preparation beforehand is important . gather up the supplies you will need for they type of training you will be conducting . these might include items like a hand - held perch , a towel , a clicker if clicker training , a chopstick or drumstick if target training , a leashharness if taking training outdoors , bitter apple spray to make common areas of parrot nibbling like draperies unappealing , and , of course , treats . choose a treat that your parrot especially enjoys , and also that you can easily feed to your bird . thin apple wedges , for example , can make a good hand treat for a parrot . weve all heard that old dogs have trouble learning new tricks , and the same principle holds true for just about any animal , including parrots and people , for that matter . begin the process of training your bird as soon as possible . so long as your parrot has reached the point of being capable if not yet entirely willing to eat a treat from your hand , you can begin training . hold multiple training sessions during the day , ideally at similar times each day for consistency , but more importantly when the parrot is in the mood for learning that is , calm . however , keep the sessions relatively short â€” no longer than fifteen minutes at a time . once your bird begins to lose interest , it is best to end the session and begin again another time . rewarding your bird with a treat from your hand is essential to practically every type of parrot training out there . it also helps establish a bond between you and a new andor young parrot . start the process with the parrot inside its cage . slowly approach and present the treat . stay calm and offer only encouraging approval when the bird eventually takes the treat . apple slices , again , make a good treat option if youre worried about having your fingers nibbled upon . you can also wear gloves , if you so choose , though your bird may find those even more appealing to peck at . shaping is a training ideology that focuses upon rewarding the bird for approximations , and eventually deliberate acting , of the steps required to complete a training task . shaping is well - named , for it is all about molding behaviors through positive reinforcement . as one example , if you were teaching your parrot to bathe itself in a small water dish , you would reward the bird for among several other intermediary steps looking toward the dish , looking at the dish , moving toward the dish , moving to the dish , testing the water , stepping into the water , and eventually splashing around . pets ranging from birds to cats can often benefit from clicker training , which involves using a hand - held clicking device think of the sound a pen clicker or metal juice - bottle cap makes to indicate proper behavior worthy of a reward . the click serves as an audible cue that an appropriate response has occurred , and should occur immediately upon said response and be accompanied immediately by a reward . thus , you may hear the phrase click and treat to describe what is essentially a single maneuver . for instance , if using a clicker during step up training â€” as detailed elsewhere in this article â€” the click and treat would occur immediately upon the parrot stepping up onto your fingerhand . clicking can be incorporated into virtually any training program . another training option , which can be used in combination with a clicker if desired , is known as target training . it uses a birds natural curiosity in investigating new objects to build a reliable response . in a basic version of target training , a chopstick , drumstick , or other wooden wand is pointed in the vicinity of the parrot , and any contact with the tip is immediately rewarded with a treat or click and treat , if desired . slowly , over time , the parrot will learn to follow the target throughout the cage and around the room , in the process learning to obey a simple command prompt . target training builds a key basic skill , therefore , that serves as a gateway to more specific training . as the name indicates , this skill involves your bird learning to step or hop from one perch to another as directed , with the target perch usually your hand , finger , or hand - held perch such as a dowel rod . the step up is an ideal skill to teach early on for several reasonsit is relatively easy to master for both teacher and student . it derives from a natural parrot behavior , the desire to move from perch to perch . it is practical , as having your bird hop into your hand on command makes everything from playtime to cage - cleaning easier . it leads into other , more detailed skills as a basic maneuver . while the step up is a simple skill , there are numerous training methods of varying complexity from which to choose , a few of which are described in the following steps . if your new bird has some prior training experience or just a natural inclination , the simplest training option may be sufficient . offer your finger or wrist to your parrot depending on the birds size and your preference , placing it in front of the bird at mid - breast level . many birds will naturally step up onto the new perch without any coaching at all . create a cue for the behavior , either by saying step up or employing a clicker simultaneous to the parrot making its move . reward the bird immediately as well . if the bird does not step up unprompted , employ shaping and reward incremental behaviors , such as touching the perch with the beak , placing one foot on the perch , etc . in this method , you use the treat more as a lure to coax the desired behavior , but the basic training principles are quite similar . hold the treat in one hand , and offer the other handfinger to the bird at chest level . orient your hands so that the easiest way for the parrot to reach the treat is by stepping up onto the offered perch . if your bird does not immediately step up , reward any contact with the offered perch at first , and incrementally reward only the desired step - up behavior . if youre handy enough with the clicker to use it while both hands are occupied , it can be incorporated , andor a verbal cue like saying step up . if other methods have been less successful , or you have been utilizing target training already , you can teach the step - up by employing the familiar target and reward system . hold your familiar target â€” a wooden drumstick , for instance â€” in one hand , and your desired perch your finger , hand , or hand - held perch in the other . alternatively , if your manual dexterity is up to the task , you can do both with one hand , which leaves the other for holding treats , a clicker , etc . locate the target so that it directs the bird to the new perch , which should be located in the common step - up position at the birds chest . immediately reward positive behavior , and use the clicker or a verbal cue if desired . eventually , the target will no longer be required to prompt the behavior . especially for people new to parrot ownership , talking is usually the first skill they think of teaching and of which they presume their bird will be able to master . the truth of the matter is , every parrot is different , and you should never acquire a bird â€” even of a breed known for talking â€” with the assumption that it will talk . some parrots will require little or no training to learn to talk , and may in fact pick up words and phrases youd prefer they not repeat . excited utterances â€” such as things you might shout at the tv during a sporting event â€” are often more readily picked up by a parrot , and theyre listening more often than you may think . so be careful what you say around them , parrots talk to other members of their flock , and it is easier to establish yourself as part of your birds flock early in its life . therefore , you are more likely to have success when starting with a baby bird . use a clear , calm , happy voice to repeat a simple word or phrase as you start the training process . think about how you would try to teach a human child to say mommy . early in the process , reward any sound , then any approximately accurate sound , and eventually a recognizable sound with an immediate treat . repetition is the key element of training a parrot to talk . simply put , the more times you say a word or phrase around a parrot , the more likely it is to pick it up and repeat it . train as often as you like . parrots will not tire of conversing with another member of their flock , although you may . some experts recommend recording yourself saying a phrase and playing it back on a loop for the bird . of course , by using this method you lose the personal interaction between the two of you ."

inch wide white velcro . stick - on velcro works fine , or you can get the type that doesnt have adhesive backing . you need enough to line the shirt opening , the collar and the sleeve openings , so you may want to take measurements before purchasing velcro . a needle and white thread or a sewing machine , if you have one . a measuring tape and scissors . use a small pair of scissors to snip off all the buttons . take care to snip the threads just underneath the buttons without cutting a hole in the shirt . snip the buttons from the opening of the shirt , the collar and the sleeve openings . thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread . insert the needle from inside the shirt near the edge of a buttonhole . stitch the buttonhole tightly closed , then finish it off by tying another tight knot . repeat until youve sewn every buttonhole closed , including those around the collar and sleeve openings . you might want to double - thread the needle if youre working with thin or weak thread . neat , invisible stitching is not the goal just make sure the buttonholes are tightly closed and wont pop open when youre handling bees . measure the length of the shirt opening . place the measuring tape along the edge of the shirts opening . measure the length of the opening from the tip of the shirttail to the bottom of the collar . write down the measurement , then use it to cut two pieces of velcro that will stretch the entire length of the shirt opening on both sides . remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces . sew a piece of velcro over the length of the opening where you cut off the buttons . sew another piece of velcro along the underside of the opening where you sewed up the buttonholes . the two pieces of velcro should seal firmly together when you close the shirt . if you have a sewing machine , you can quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place . stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down . you can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle . if youre sewing by hand , make tight , neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while youre wearing your bee suit . use the measuring tape to measure around the collar . cut a length of velcro according to your measurement , and sew it around the inside of the collar . cut a second length and sew it around the outside of the collar . this will allow you to adjust the collar to make it tight enough to keep bees out . use the same method to add velcro to the sleeve openings . again , a sewing machine makes it easy to quickly sew down the velcro strips to secure them in place . stitch the entire length of the velcro to hold it down . you can stitch along the edges of the velcro or make one long stitch down the middle . if youre sewing by hand , make tight , neat stitches so that the velcro does not come loose while youre wearing your bee suit . a cowboy - style hat with a wide brim makes the perfect base for your beekeeping hat . it will keep the veil from touching your face as you work , making it easier to see and less likely that a bee will get close enough to your skin to sting . look for a hat with these qualitiesthe fabric is thick enough to keep out bees , but thin enough to pierce with a sewing needle . felt and tightly - woven straw hats work well leather can be too thick . the hat is lightweight enough that you wont overheat . youll be doing most of your beekeeping in the summer , so keep that in mind when you choose your hate . the brim is stiff , not floppy . it should be firm enough to keep the veil several inches from your face . you can use stiff nylon mesh , tulle , or wire mesh to make the veil . you need enough veil fabric to fit around the brim of the hat and fall at least five inches below your shoulders . one yard should be sufficient . be sure to use a clear or white fabric so that youll be able to see through it easily . if you find a thin tulle you want to use , you may need a double layer to make sure your veil keeps the bees away . measure around the brim of the hat , then cut your fabric about an inch wider . youll need a bit of overlap to make sure the bees cant get through the seam . make sure the fabric is long enough to drape down five inches below your shoulders . overlap the edges by half an inch . stitch the edges closed to create a large tube of fabric with the same circumference as your hats brim . make sure the tube is sturdy enough to keep out bees before moving to the next step . it doesnt hurt to add an extra row of stitches along the seam . working by hand , carefully sew the top edge of the veil around the brim of the hat . if you are hand - sewing , be sure to use small whip - stitches to keep all openings too small for the bees to enter and get underneath the mesh . continue until the veil is tightly secured to the hat . your bee - tight shirt and hat are the most important parts , but in order for your suit to work , youll need a few more items . remember that everything should be white or light in colorthick white sweatpants or work pants . make sure they have tight elastic around the waist and ankles . you can also wear white workout pants if sweatpants are too hot . tall socks . thick gloves . dishwashing gloves work just fine . some beekeepers prefer to be bare -

piece suit . make sure the coverall you purchase is white or light in color . dark colors can aggravate bees since these colors remind them of their predators , like bears and skunks . make sure the coverall fits loosely in order to keep the material from directly contacting the skin . this helps to avoid stingers that might pierce the fabric . measure elastic to fit the neck hole and wrists , then cut the elastic to the correct measurements . sew the elastic pieces around neck opening and wrist openings . this is important to prevent bees from gaining access to the inside of the coverall . dont make the elastic too tight , but it should be tight enough to offer protection from bees . when putting on the beekeepers suit , put the hat on first , then the coveralls . make sure the mesh of the hat is securely tucked in at the neck of the coveralls . add gloves , socks and boots to the ensemble ."
42,"look for a bee larger than the others in the hive . look for a bee with a pointed abdomen . using a magnifying glass , look for a bee without a barb on its stinger . look for a bee that stands with its legs splayed apart . watch the way the other bees act subserviently around her .",how to identify a queen bee,"the easiest way to tell the queen bee apart from other bees is by her size . queens mated with drones are the largest bees in the hive , both longer and wider than other bees , while queens who have yet to mate , or virgin queens , are smaller than mated queens but larger than either worker bees or drones . the queen bees larger size , as well as her ability to lay eggs , is due to eating protein - rich royal jelly , which is secreted from glands on the heads of young worker bees and mixed with pollen to form a whitish milk or mush . all bees are fed royal jelly for the first few days after hatching , but only queen bees are fed royal jelly until reaching physical maturity . royal jelly not only enables queen bees to mature sexually , it also enables them to reach physical maturity sooner after 16 days as opposed to 21 days for worker bees and contributes to their extended lifespan . virgin queens are reared in the event the mated queen becomes old or incapacitated . they are kept separate from the mated queen and each other if 1 virgin queen encounters another , she will attack and attempt to kill it . a queen bees larger abdomen is noticeably more pointed than the abdomens of either worker or drone bees . worker bees stingers are barbed once they sting a target , the barb catches and pulls the stinger from their abdomen , killing the worker . queen bees , however , have no barbs on their stingers , enabling them to sting a target repeatedly . necessary because of her greater size , keeping her legs splayed apart , like those of the bug in the game of cootie , enables the queen bee to move quickly through the hive . as long as the queen bee is healthy and productive , worker bees are notably deferential to her , getting out of her way when she moves forward and standing at attention facing her when she stops ."

offs to loosen and remove the shoe . close the jaws of the pull - offs around the outside heel of the shoe and use an outside to center rocking motion , working towards the toe to loosen the shoe . repeat for the inside heel and proceed in this fashion until the shoe can be pulled off . several alternatives exist for breaking the nail clinches . in a pinch , you can use a rock and a flat head screwdriver to bend the nail tips upwards , or , if youre careful not to wear a hole in the hoof wall , you can even use a rasp to file the nail clinches away . for your horses health and safety , you dont want dirt or debris trapped between its new shoe and its foot . before shoeing your horse , use a hoof pick to remove any compacted dirt , mud , rocks , manure , etc . from your horses foot . use downward strokes from heel to toe . follow the hoof pick with a wire brush for added cleanliness . take care around the frog - the triangular portion in the middle of the hoof . this part of the hoof is extra - sensitive . typically , before a horse is shod , the dark , hard , outer layer of each hoofs sole is removed to reveal the softer , whiter material underneath in a process roughly equivalent to trimming a humans toenails . take care not to cut too deep , or you risk hurting the horse or even rendering it temporarily lame - the same as if youd cut a persons nails too short . this process is easiest if you keep your hoof knife razor sharp . but use caution . its easy to accidentally slip and cut yourself while working . the hoof wall - the edge of the hoof - should extend about 3 inches 7 . 6Â cm to 3  34 inches from the hairline above the hoof itself . if its any longer , use a set of nippers essentially giant nail clippers to trim the edge of the hoof to a suitable length . you should see a ridge where the hoof wall extends beyond the sole . do not cut into the sole with the nippers , or you may injure the horse . when you trim the hoof with nippers , be sure to keep the trimmed edges of the hoof uniformly straight and level so that theyll sit flush with the ground . trim from each side of the heel to the toe . the exception to this is in cases where a horses gait wears its hoof unevenly - in this case , youll want to take slightly less hoof material off of the side that the horse favors . use caution when making this distinction and , if unsure , consult an experienced farrier . the very last thing that must be done to prepare the hoof for its shoe is to ensure the bottom of the hoof is smooth , flat and level . use a rasp to gently file any uneven spots on the bottom of the hoof , taking care , as always , not to wear the hoof too short or irritate the frog . then using your knife , pare away slightly to bevel the sole away from the hoof wall . contact of the sole on the shoe can cause the horse discomfort . as with human feet , horse feet come in many different sizes and , thus , different horses will require different - sized shoes . before proceeding , ensure that the shoes you have available are the correct size for your horses feet . note that a horses front and hind feet are differently - shaped , so you will need different shoes for each . most horses have a size smaller in the back then the front , but not always . if you have to choose between shoes that are slightly too big and shoes that are slightly too small , choose the bigger shoes . these can be bent , shaped , and ground down to a smaller size , while too - small shoes cant be made bigger . too long a shoe in front will cause the horse to step on the exposed heel of the shoe and pull it off . often , even if horse shoes are the correct size , they will not fit a horses foot without adjustments . like human feet , horse feet can be asymmetrical or uneven . there are several ways to custom - shape horseshoes . if youre a knowledgeable metalworker , you can heat the shoe until the steel can be bent to the size of the hoof . or , you can cold shape the shoe on an anvil using a hammer and tongs . some farriers do neither , opting instead to grind their shoes down until they fit with a rasp or grinding machine . well - fitting horse shoes should align well with the edge of the hoof . keep in mind that it may take some time to get a shoe to the perfect size for your horse . align the shoe so that it sits perfectly against the edge of the hoof , then drive nails through the holes in the shoe to fix it to the horses foot . when doing this , care must be taken so as not to hurt or hobble the horse . drive the nail through the hoof at an outward angle so that the nail tips go through the top of the hoof wall . never drive nails into the sensitive inner portion of the hoof . to make this easier , use hoof nails that have a bevel on one side to guide the tip through the hoof wall . with these special nails , the manufacturers stamp on the side of the nail head should face the center of the foot towards the frog - this ensures that the bevel is facing the right direction . some modern horseshoes use glue , rather than nails , to hold the shoe in place . if youre worried about hurting your horse , you may want to try this alternative . note that application methods for glue - on shoes can vary - consult the manufacturer or an experienced farrier for more information . once each nail has been driven , use the claw end of your hammer to bend the tip of the nail over against the hoof wall . then , twist off the tip or use a pair of nippers to bend and clip the tips off . try leave about 18 of the tip bent over the edge of the hole formed by the nail pointing towards the toe . this ensures that the nail will hold the shoe in place without the sharp tip hurting you or the horse . set a clinch block under the nail on the outer hoof wall , then set the nail in the hoof or clinch it by hitting the nail head once again with the driving hammer . this gives the nail a firm grip in the horses hoof , ensuring the shoe stays in place . you may use a sturdy metal tool , like your nippers , in place of the clinch block in a pinch . another option is to use a special tool called a clincher . with this tool , all you need to do is align the jaws of the clincher over the nail tip and squeeze the handles . finally , give the outside of the hoof a once - over with a rasp , smoothing out any uneven spots and giving the hoof a nice clean finish . pay special attention to the clinched nail tips , which can also be filed smooth . when finished , you should be able to draw a cloth over the hoof wall without it catching . you may also notice that excess hoof material protrudes over the edge of the shoe . if this is the case , use a pair of nippers or pull - offs to remove it . remember that the front and back hooves will require differently - shaped shoes and that even the two front and back feet may not be perfectly symmetrical with each other ."

taken allergy medications . they are available over the counter or by prescription , and they come in tablet , syrup , or nasal spray forms . antihistamines reduce your bodys immune system response to allergens . an antihistamine can help reduce itchy skin , sneezing , and runny nose . common over - the - counter tablets include fexofenadine allegra , loratadine claritin , alavert and cetirizine zyrtec . common prescription tablets include levocetirizine xyzal and desloratadine clarinex . frequently - prescribed nasal sprays include azelastine astelin and astepro and olopatadine patanase . decongestants reduce nasal swellinginflammation , which can make it easier to breathe if youre experiencing sneezing or stuffy nose . they are often sold as nasal sprays , and can typically be acquired without a prescription . some over - the - counter allergy medications pair antihistamines and decongestants together in one oral tablet . decongestants arent for everyone . they can have serious negative side effects for some individuals , including elevated blood pressure . if you currently have high blood pressure , glaucoma , cardiovascular disease , or an enlarged prostate , do not take decongestants unless your doctor has told you it is safe to do so . corticosteroid nasal sprays are inserted into the nostril , sprayed , and inhaled . this class of medicine is typically administered in low doses and tend to have far fewer side effects than oral corticosteroids . common nasal sprays that are available without a prescription include fluticasone flonase , mometasone furoate nasonex , and triamcinolone nasacort aq . if over - the - counter nasal sprays arent enough , ask your doctor whether prescription - strength corticosteroids might help your symptoms . if youre experiencing an allergic reaction to guinea pigs in your home , you may find it helpful to use an air filter or purifier . these products help remove allergens from the air , reducing respiratory problems and potentially reducing contact of airborne particles with your skin . if you purchase an air filterpurifier , make sure you use a high - efficiency particulate air hepa filters and air purifiers . hepa filters and purifiers have been shown to reduce airborne allergens in some environments . if you or a family member are experiencing guinea pig allergies , make sure your guinea pig is not permitted to roam freely around the house . this can help limit or even eliminate exposure to the allergens , which may make it easier to live with a guinea pig in the home for some individuals . keep your guinea pigs cage in a designated area that can be avoided . do not put it in common areas like the living room or kitchen , or innear your bedroom . the room where you keep your guinea pig should ideally be uncarpeted for ease of cleaning . wood , tile , linoleum , or vinyl flooring materials are much easier to clean and will not harbor allergens like a carpet would . if youre allergic to guinea pigs , its important to remember that the protein responsible for that allergy is mostly found in the animals saliva and urine . however , that protein can be transferred to the guinea pigs coat or skin during grooming or passing waste , and may be transferred to your skin if you handle the guinea pig or its bedding . therefore , the urine , saliva , hair , and skin dander should all be considered potential sources of allergen exposure . exposure to these allergens can cause symptoms immediately , or after numerous days , weeks , months , or even years of exposure . if you are unable to avoid being around a guinea pig for whatever reason , make sure you avoid contact with these sources of allergens . if contact cannot be avoided , make sure you take protective measures . protective equipment may allow you to handle guinea pigs and their bedding or simply be around guinea pigs without experiencing allergic reactions . protective equipment may not be enough , though , and you may need to take some type of allergy medication for extra safety . wearing a dust mask can help prevent bronchial irritation and asthma -

sleeved shirt you wore while handling your guinea pig for other purposes unless its been washed since the last time you came into contact with the guinea pig or its bedding . any time youve handled a guinea pig , cleaned its enclosure , or handled any materials from inside that enclosure , make sure you wash your hands as soon as possible . its important to follow proper hand - washing techniques to ensure that your skin is clean and free of allergens to reduce or prevent a reaction . get your hands wet under the faucet with clean , running water . the temperature doesnt really matter , since the point is to wash away allergens and not germs . apply enough soap to adequately cover both hands with the lather . work the soap between your hands , between your fingers , on the backs of your hands , and under your fingernails . apply soap to any other part of your body that may have come in contact with allergens wrists and arms , for example . scrub the soap on your skin for at least 20 seconds . a common way to keep time is by singing or humming the happy birthday song twice in a row while you scrub your skin . if youve been bitten or scratched by a guinea pig , wash the site of your injury with soap and water for 15 minutes or longer to ensure that you remove the allergens from the wound . rub your hands under the tap to wash away any traces of soap , which should also remove the allergens your skin came into contact with . use a clean , dry paper towel to wipe your hands dry . discard the paper towel when you are finished . depending on your situation , you may be able to find someone else willing to take on guinea pig duties for you . ask others you live or work with if they would be willing to take over these responsibilities . if you work at a pet store , let your supervisors know that youve experienced allergic reactions to guinea pigs and request that you be excused from handling , feeding , or cleaning them . if your guinea pig is a pet at home , ask a family member or roommate to take over guinea pig duties . if you cant find anyone willing to do this , you may have to consider giving your guinea pig to a home where allergies wont be a problem . though its always difficult to part with a pet , you may not have a choice if your allergies are severe . talk to pet stores and adoption agencies in your region to see if they can help you find a new home for your guinea pig . you should also make sure that any home your pet ends up in is safe by talking to the prospective buyeradopter and asking about his or her previous pet ownership and animal care experience . if youre experiencing allergies around a guinea pig , there is a slight chance that it may not be the guinea pig itself causing your reactions . an allergist can help you identify whether youre allergic to some environmental factor , like haystraw used for the animals bedding . hay and straw often cause asthma - like reactions , including difficulty breathing , increased production of mucus , and congestion in the chest . many people experience dermatitis symptoms as an allergic reaction to skin contact with haystraw . dermatitis is usually characterized by red , itchy , or inflamed skin . it may look like a rash on the skin , usually at the point of exposure . some people experience allergic reactions to wood shavings that are commonly used as guinea pig bedding . talk to an allergist , or try out a different bedding material thats free from any potential allergens . even if wood shavings themselves arent the problem , many people experience allergies to the various coloring , fragrances , and oils added to guinea pig bedding . eucalyptus oil and manuka oil are common additives to guinea pig bedding . make sure your wood shavings do not have any of these additives , or try a different bedding material altogether . if bedding isnt the issue , there is a slight chance you may be allergic to the food youre feeding your guinea pig . handling food or treats that contain an artificial color or other additives could be whats causing your reaction , though only an allergist can confirm this for sure . artificial coloring agents that begin with the letter e , such as e110 , are commonly added to dried food and treats . these coloring agents have produced allergic reactions in some individuals , though again , its more likely that youre allergic to the animal itself or its bedding . talk to an allergist to determine the source of your allergies and find ways to treat or avoid those allergens ."

75 degrees fahrenheit . guinea pigs dont do well in humid locations such as sheds and garages on hot days . humidity encourages bacteria to grow and can cause a fungal infection . guinea pigs have sensitive hearing so shouldnt be placed in an area that is prone to loud noises such as right beside televisions or loud stereos . if you have young children , place your guinea pigs cage in a room where you can monitor them and supervise any small children at the same time . as much as its popular , keeping your guinea pig outdoors isnt suggested as they dont like being confined in solitary . make your guinea pig feel a part of the family . keeping them in your bedroom should also be avoided as its another way for them to be forgotten . if youre buying a cage that requires a ramp , or already comes with one , make sure the ramp you acquire is suitable for your guinea pig . the ramp mustnt be too steep where your guinea pig is prone too falling and it should have a good grip on it so that your guinea pig can go up and down with no problems . there are many types of bedding to avoid when it comes to choosing the perfect material for your guinea pig . this includes certain brands and even certain wood . never use cedar or pine shavings . these type of wood are toxic to guinea pigs and can cause serious respiratory problems . the oils in them get stuck in their lungs . however , pine can be used as long as its aired out . never use sawdust . again , the dust that is inhaled by guinea pigs is a major cause of respiratory disease and sneezing . never use corncob bedding . corncob has a tendency to mold and is hard on their feet . since guinea pigs have sensitive feet you should steer clear of corncob . never primarily use newspaper . although newspaper is perfectly fine itself and can be used as lining at the bottom of the cage , it isnt absorbent enough to use as your main bedding . never use straw . straw is tough and can easily cause eye injuries . it isnt absorbent enough to be used as bedding and can also be expensive . many guinea pig experts suggest to stay away from wood shavings as a lot of risks are involved with the use of this material such as oils that dry the skin , dust that ultimately causes respiratory problems and possible eye irritation . fleece is a popular choice to use as bedding as it seems to have little to no problems at all . however , keeping your guinea pig on fleece will require more regular cleaning including spot cleaning daily and an overall clean weekly . shredded bedding can be purchased from pet stores or you can shred your own . its quite absorbent and soft on your cavies feet without any toxins in it . this makes it a safe material to use . however , it will absorb their urine and make the smell linger . carefresh helps eliminate odours and is soft on the guinea pigs feet . however , some tend to avoid unnaturally scented or colored bedding to lessen any risks . aspen is another popular choice as it contains no toxic oils , unnatural scents or dyes . its completely natural and safe to use . you can buy this specific kind of bedding at pet stores . hay can be quite absorbent , natural , safe and help control odours . however , its quite pricey if you dont buy it from the right place . pet stores are notorious for overcharging when it comes to hay . but you can easily purchase hay from equestrian centers or farm stops for approximately 5 a bale . you can opt for a water bottle or a water bowl which are completely different to each other . you can always buy both if you have more than one guinea pig . water bottles keep bedding , food and hay out of the water if your guinea pig is living in a smaller area but theyre notorious for leaking and soiling the bedding . water bowls dont leak and are a more natural way for your guinea pig to acquire water . but they can get messy if you use wood shavings as bedding or keep their foodhay nearby . the guinea pig pellets should be kept inside the bowl for hygienic reasons and to keep them from spoiling . you can purchase two if you would like to keep their vegetables in a bowl also or even more if you have two guinea pigs or more that require 1 cup of vegetables each . guinea pigs are prey animals their instinct is to hide when in fear . you need to have at least one or two hide - outs for your guinea pigs as a safe place and a relaxing centre . one of the worst things you can do is stress your guinea pig out , and with the option of seeking refuge in a hut , you can reduce stress levels . toys help stimulate the mind and encourage exercise and , of course , promote fun and enjoyment toys are a great way to reduce boredom , depression and even loneliness . however , dont overcrowd their cage with toys . guinea pigs need space to run too toy obstacles can promote exercise whilst chew toys can help prevent dentistry problems as guinea pig teeth are forever growing . consider toys such as igloos , tunnels , bridges , wood blocks , cat toys with bells on them , cage accessories , hammocks , cosies , etc . dont buy wood toys that splinter , wire balls or any toys that can be a choking hazard . hay racks can help bundle the hay together and keep it in place , making the overall space of the cage cleaner and more hygienic . however , avoid wire hay racks and opt for cotton bagssacks instead . there are a number of incidences of guinea pigs getting their headsbodies stuck in between the wires . guinea pigs need their cages cleaned at least once a week and sometimes daily if you decide to spot clean especially if youre using fleece bedding . you will need a brush , cloth , gloves , pet - friendly antibacterial spray , scooper , bin bags , etc . this is optional and most apply to long - haired breeds such as peruvians and shelties . however , you can choose to have some grooming products set aside for whenever you need it . you could also optionally book an appointment with a professional groomer . purchase a soft bristled brush . long haired guinea pigs require daily grooming to prevent knots and matting from forming in their fur . purchase clippers . long - haired breeds such as shelties have constant growing fur that require clipping annually or perhaps every few months . buy nail trimmers . occasionally you might have to purchase nail trimmers to clip your guinea pigs over - grown nails . unless you got your hutch home already assembled on a trailer it will require assembling , including store - bought hutches . hutches are quite easy to assemble providing that you have the instructions and all the parts to it . your hutch should be out of direct sunlight and preferably in a weather proof area under the roof of the house . the area should be well ventilated , secured away from predators and other pets and not too cold or too hot . straw or wood shavings is recommended for hutches . ones that go directly on grass will only need bedding in the inside area . consider lining the hutch with newspaper first and then your main bedding . guinea pig urine can stain bottom of wooden hutches . the newspaper should catch any leaks . hutches are best without the use of fleece . water bottles can connect to the wire bars of the hutch or you can opt towards a water bowl instead . keep your water bowl a short distance from the pellets to prevent mess . guinea pigs benefit with at least two shelters to escape to when in fear , especially in an outdoor hutch where many wild animals can scare your guinea pig . avoid overcrowding the hutch and keep most of the toys outside at the bottom level if its a two - story hutch . cosies can be kept in the inside area but to a minimum . most hay racks can be pitched up between the wires of the hutch , even cotton hay racks . the hay rack would be best positioned on the bottom story of the cage or away from the water bowl . remember , guinea pigs will make a lot of mess when it comes to hay . they like to hide in it , pull it out and sleep in it . the ramp shouldnt be too steep but should have a good grip on it so your guinea pigs can move up and down without any struggles or slips . it should optionally have juts to make the grip better . firstly connect the grids which should be able to snap together easily with connectors . then you will have to set the coroplast at the same length as your grids . make sure the opening of the cube grids arent too bigwide enough for your guinea pig to fit its head through . if its head can fit through then its body will fit through too . c  cs are not outdoor cages as they arent secure or weather proof at all keep it in a room where you can supervise any young children but also keep it away from pets and loud noises . however , do not isolate the cage . the guinea pigs should feel a part of the family not placed in solitary confinement . your bottom layer should be lined up with newspaper for extra absorbency and to catch any leaks , and then your primary bedding . fleece is best suited for c  c cages , but it doesnt limit you to the choice of many other types of bedding such as wood shavings or carefresh . water bottles can be hooked onto the grids and your bowls can be positioned beside your water source unless youre using a bowl . dont place the pellets directly under the water bottle as bottles have the tendency to leak which will spoil the feed . in an open cage without a lid , you should have plenty of coverage with the use of huts , bridges , shelters and hide - outs to help your guinea pig feel safe and secure and to give them a place to run to when in fear . at least two should be satisfactory for your guinea pig - the more guinea pigs the more hide - outs , a spacious c  c cage could benefit with some toys for your guinea pigs entertainment . you could add various tunnels , hammocks and toy balls . you can hook the hay rack onto the grid or , if you dont have one , place a pile of hay in the centre of the cage . most hay racks can be purchased online or in pet stores . avoid wire racks however . coops are very similar to hutches but most are a lot bigger than guinea pig hutches . you can assemble them in the same manner . they should come with instructions and all the necessary parts to assemble . coop best dwells on grass , which will save you on bedding expenses . theres no need for lining the bottom layer with bedding as long as the coop is resting on grass . most coops can go in direct sunlight as their construction and frame offers permanent shade for your piggy , but keep it under the shade of a tree on hotter days . coops can go on grass so it saves you spending a fortune on bedding . but the nesting boxarea still needs to be lined up with bedding . its suggested to line a bottom layer of newspaper and then shavingshay . like other cages , the bottle can grip onto the gridswiring . however , keep your pellets away from the edges of the cage as sudden rainy showers can spoil the unprotected food . keep it under the nesting boxramp . the ramp shouldnt be too steep and should have a proper grip via soft sandpaper or juts in the ramp structure . if your guinea pig is slipping or struggling to go up and down the ramp , you might need to make some adjustments as the ramp is designed for chickens rather than rodents . guinea pigs still need a place to escape to even in a protected coop . if your guinea pigs live outdoors its important for your guinea pigs to have a quick place to hide , especially on the lower level . tunnels , cosies , toy balls and wood blocks can all make the coop seem a lot homely and friendly to your guinea pigs . avoid adding too many toys , however . the hay rack should be able to clip onto the grids of the coop . opt for cotton hay racks instead of wire hack racks which are proven to be dangerous to your guinea pig . you should place it at the bottom of the cage . wired cages are just as easy to assemble as hutches and c  c caging . theyre actually very similar to c  c cages and can be set up the same way . wired cages arent suitable to go outdoors and should be kept inside your home . the cage offers no protection from predators or harsh weather conditions thus why it should be kept inside of your house where the guinea pig can get plenty of family interaction . the type of bedding you use is very similar to c  c cages . fleece is the most popular options , however you can still use any other bedding choice available . you should line newspaper at the bottom to ensure extra absorbency and so that you can catch leaks . as usual , the bottles can be hung up by the grids whilst pellets should be placed in the bowl and away from the water source to prevent leaks into the food . you should provide at least two huts for your guinea pig , however keep it at a minimum as the space is limited . space availability in wire cages can be limited , so keep the toys to a minimum . the maximum might be three or four . remember to add various toys such as tunnels , wood blocks and hammocks for your guinea pigs to play with . as mentioned in the steps above you can hook the hay rack to the cage , but avoid using wired hay racks with can pose a potential hazard to your guinea pig ."
50,"purchase or build a cage . line the cage up with absorbent bedding . choose where to keep the cage . decide on water bottles or water bowls . purchase a food bowl . purchase food prior to the arrival of your guinea pigs . choose your hay . purchase a hay dispenser . purchase huts , tunnels and toys for your guinea pig .",how to prepare for your new guinea pig,"guinea pigs can be housed in three different types of cages c  c , hutches or runs . you can purchase these from warehousepet stores or build your own . the cage must be at least 4 square feet for each guinea pig housed in it the more the better or at least 8 square feet for two . dont fall into the trap of buying inappropriate sized cages from pet shops that do not hold enough space for guinea pigs . if you want to keep your guinea pig indoors then a c  c cage is recommended . hutches are recommended if youre keeping your guinea outside . the cage must have a solid floor . dont purchase one with a wired floor as guinea pigs have fragile feet . wire flooring can and will easily cause bumble foot . most c  c cages do not have lids . if your cage is going outdoors , you have small children or dangerous pets in the house then you will need a lid on your cage . do not use an aquarium for a cage as the glass sides dont provide good ventilation and most are terribly small . you will need two layers of bedding to ensure extra absorbency as guinea pigs tend to wee a lot . your first layer should be either newspaper or puppy pads which will take in any leaks and protect the flooring . the second layer should be either wood shavings or fleece lined on top of the first layer . fleece is more suitable for indoor cages such as c  c cages but will require more regular cleaning and possibly spot cleaning . and cleaning the fleece is a bit more difficult as you will need to shake off and vacuum the fleece before washing it . wood shavings require less regular cleaning and is generally easier to clean . its also less smelly and more absorbent . you will want to keep the cage in an area where its safe , secure and away from any toxins or dangerous pets . guinea pigs like somewhere that doesnt get too stressful or too noisy - somewhere that gets light traffic . keep the cage out of direct , constant sunlight . morning sun is adequate for guinea pigs but they prefer to keep out of constant sunlight . keep the cage away from any dangerous pets and small children . dogs and cats will easily scare your guinea pigs as would small children who arent supervised . do not keep the cage in a garage where toxic fumes are given off from cars . this could be fatal to your guinea pigs . water bottles are less messy but some do leak . however bowls dont leak and are more natural to the guinea pig but if you use wood shavings expect to see some mess . some guinea pigs prefer to drink from bottles whilst other like bowls as a more natural instinct . ask the previous owner of the guinea pigs to see which one they use . remember to never add vitamin supplements to your guinea pigs water as it isnt effective and your guinea pig could refuse to drink . your guinea pig will need somewhere to eat . purchase two bowls - one for pellets and one for vegetables . you should avoid chucking their food on the ground as its unsanitary . guinea pigs will need pellets and plenty of vegetables every day . pellets should be unlimited however whilst they need 1 cup of mixed vegetables a day each . so make sure to plan ahead make sure to purchase plain pellets rather than a guinea pig mix . guinea pigs will pick out their favourite treats out of a mix which results to them not eating what they actually need . you can also optionally purchase commercial treats if you plan on training your guinea pig . however , treats should be kept to a limit due to the high sugar content . guinea pigs need an unlimited supply of hay as they are grazing animals . if they arent constantly chewing on something their digestive tracts can shut down . purchase a reliable , good quality manufacture of hay such as oxbow andor timothy hay . alfalfa should only be fed to guinea pig pups and nursing or pregnant sows . an hay dispenser will lessen the mess of hay and make it last longer rather than scattering the hay on the floor . you can purchase a hay dispenser from a pet shop or use a small paper bin instead . a main criteria that needs to be met for guinea pigs is entertainment and comfort through toys and tunnels . you should have at least two hutstunnels or one huttunnel per guinea pig . guinea pigs like being hidden and need a place to run to when scared or in conflict . you can build a critter - safe hut or find one at a pet store . some log tunnels even act as a double as they import into bridges due to their flexibility if tied together with string . toys are a great boredom buster for guinea pigs but make sure the toy you purchase is safe and has no negative reviews . some toys can be dangerous so watch out . something as simple to chew on could be a great and beneficial toy for your guinea pig and help grind down their large teeth ."

dwelling monkeys from south america and families of old world primates larger , ground and tree - dwelling monkeys from asia and africa . each type of monkey has unique characteristics that affect how they fare as pets . before you decide which type to get , conduct a lot of research on its characteristics . read books , talk to owners , and get to know as many monkeys as you can in person . squirrel monkeys , capuchins , spiders , and macaques are all types of monkeys people keep as pets . some are more social , while others can be on the nervous side . these monkeys all have the same general care requirements , though larger monkeys will need more space than the smaller ones . apes , such a chimpanzees , gibbons and orangutans are not monkeys and should not be kept as pets . they are much stronger than humans and can become quite dangerous in a domestic situation . bringing a monkey into your home is almost as big a commitment as deciding to have a child . monkeys require attention all day , every day , and unlike cats and dogs , they cannot be left at home for extended periods of time . once your monkey bonds with you , he will want to follow you wherever you go , and if you try to leave him by himself he will become bored , depressed and aggressive . monkeys can live for 20 to 40 years , so bringing one home is a commitment to spend a significant portion of your life providing for your monkeys needs . before you decide to get a pet monkey , ponder the following facts about life with a monkey the monkey may become aggressive . when monkeys are babies , they are dependent and sweet , like baby humans . but when they reach sexual maturity , which happens around age 3 or 4 , their behavior can become unpredictable . monkeys are wild animals , and unlike cats and dogs , they have not been socialized to live with humans over thousands of years . even a monkey who has bonded with a human as a baby may unpredictably bite and attack his owner or become quite difficult to live with as an adult . youll have to say goodbye to your free time . monkeys cannot be left to their own devices . they need constant attention and care , or else they can end up hurting themselves or someone else . and since they tend to bond with just one person , its difficult to find a good monkey - sitter when you need some time to yourself . your monkey may prevent you from having relationships you want . monkeys tend to bond with just a few people . having a monkey might prevent you from getting intimately involved with potential partners to whom the monkey has a negative reaction . monkeys dont get along well with children , so having a monkey could keep you from starting a family . all that said , if you are one of the unique people with the temperament and discipline it takes to devote your life to the safety and care of your monkey , you may be rewarded with an amazing experience . monkeys are intelligent , endlessly entertaining , and sometimes incredibly affectionate . many people who share their lives with monkeys embrace the challenges and wouldnt trade their time with their beloved pets for anything . it is illegal to have a pet monkey in many states , and more states will probably pass laws against the practice in the future . for this reason , its difficult to move to a new state or travel across state lines when you own a monkey . its illegal to bring a monkey into the us , so that means you cant travel abroad with your monkey and then try to bring him home . some states allow monkeys to be kept as pets , but have strict regulations as to the conditions under which the monkeys should be contained . regulations regarding pet monkeys are different in countries outside the us . look into the laws in your jurisdiction to find out whether there are any restrictions on which animals you can keep as pets . when youve decided that its time to get a monkey , do research in your area to find a dealer or breeder with an established reputation as someone who can be trusted . they should have a usda permit number , which is required of all breeders in the united states . ask the dealer or breeder for the contact information of someone else who has bought a monkey from them . that way you can check into the monkeys health and behavior . expect to pay upwards of 1 , 000 for a monkey of any species . a baby squirrel monkey can cost over 8 , 000 . older monkeys are less expensive , but much more difficult to handle once you bring them home . before you make a purchase , visit with the monkey youd like to buy and make sure you have a connection and can see yourself living with the monkey . never purchase a monkey from outside the country . its illegal to ship a monkey from outside the united states . before you bring a monkey home , its important to establish a relationship with an exotic animals veterinarian . a regular veterinarian will not have the necessary expertise and equipment to care for a monkey . monkeys are prone to catching some of the same illnesses that humans have , as frequently as humans , so you can expect that your monkey will get sick from time to time . an exotic animals vet will also be a good resource for you when you have questions about your monkeys needs or behavioral issues . your pet monkey might spend time out of his cage , but hell need a place to stay at night and during times when you arent available to play . a monkeys cage should be quite large , the bigger the better . monkeys need plenty of room to run around , explore and play , especially if theyre going to spend more than an hour or two at a time in the cage . if the cage is too small , the monkey will become agitated and potentially aggressive . you can purchase a monkey cage , but many owners prefer to build their own so they can customize them to their personal space . wooden or steel poles and chain - link fencing make good materials for monkey cages . you may want to have an outdoor monkey cage as well as one indoors , or build a monkey cage attached to a heated outdoor shed that will provide shelter for the monkey . be sure to follow your states regulations regarding the dimensions , entryways and locks on monkey cages . in some cases the regulations differ according to what type of monkey you own . monkeys like to climb , so provide a cage with plenty of height . add branches , hanging ropes , and other features that will allow your monkey to climb around the cage . most monkey owners allow their pets to spend time around the house , rather than just in their cages . monkeys are curious , intelligent creatures that will get into everything available to them , so youll need to take the time to remove items that could cause them harm or suffer damage . since monkeys can climb , your monkey - proofing will have to be more extensive than baby - proofing would be . dont let monkeys have access to anything with a cord . make sure all electronics are out of their reach . theyll tear down curtains , knock over lamps and chew on furniture . put away any items you arent comfortable letting them destroy . you might want to have one or two designated monkey rooms that the monkeys are allowed to play in , and have the rest of the house be off - limits . remember that monkeys can turn doorknobs and open windows , so if youre planning to let the monkey stay there unsupervised , youll need to make sure the room is as secure as a cage would be , with locks and bars on the windows . monkeys keep their own bodies clean , but they leave a mess wherever they go . they arent easy to house - train , and they excrete whenever and wherever they choose . some people put diapers on baby monkeys , but this isnt usually possible once the monkeys mature . rather , you should plan on cleaning up after your monkey at least once a day to maintain sanitary conditions in the cage and in your home . monkeys should always have access to fresh water that they drink from clean water bottles . you can use baby bottles for this purpose . some monkeys may prefer to take their water from a dish , and some might like to have both options . however you administer the water , make sure theres no chance the monkey will run out . monkey biscuits , or commercial monkey food , should be fed to your monkey every single day . these biscuits contain the right combination of vitamins and minerals to meet your monkeys needs . in addition to monkey biscuits , monkeys enjoy cut up fruit and fresh or steamed vegetables . you may also feed your monkey grasshoppers , mealworms , cooked chicken with no spices , hard boiled eggs , yogurt , rice , grain and nuts . do not feed your monkey anything that is considered junk food for a human . sugary treats , ice cream , baked goods , snack foods , fast food , and raw meat should never be fed to a monkey . depending on the type of monkey you have , you may also need to supplement his diet with extra vitamins . monkeys kept inside may need extra vitamin d to account for the lack of sun exposure . monkeys need a lot of variety and stimulation in order to be happy . in the wild , they spend most of their time climbing around trees and looking for food . simulate that experience in your monkeys cage and around the house by providing lots of interesting things for the monkey to play with and pull apart . try hiding the monkeys food inside a box , or in a container with small holes that the monkey can reach one hand into . the monkey will have fun trying to figure out how to get to the food . give the monkey stuffed animals , balls , and other toys to throw around and play with . switch out the toys frequently so the monkey wont get bored . monkeys are social creatures , and when theyre left alone for long periods of time they grow very unhappy . spend a few hours playing with your monkey every single day . as you bond with your monkey , hell start trusting you enough to climb up your body and give you hugs or even kisses . if you have more than one monkey , less social time is necessary . many monkeys are happier living with others of their kind . if you can afford more than one , theyll live happily together in the same cage . hitting or yelling at a monkey will cause him to become afraid of you . its also completely ineffective if you want to control your monkeys behavior . remember that monkeys are wild , and they simply cant be trained to do exactly what you want them to do . from time to time theyll exhibit behaviors you might not like . punishing them will only hurt your relationship . the best way to deal with negative behaviors is to make sure the monkey isnt lacking something that he needs to be content . does he have enough stimulation every day is he getting plenty of exercise are you playing with him enough monkeys that are afraid or agitated might bite from time to time . again , you cant deal with this by punishing the monkey . instead , get to know his moods and learn to leave him alone when he might be in the mood to bite . its not a good idea to take your monkey out in public , or invite people to your home to play with him . monkeys are too unpredictable . your monkey can get taken away in an instant if an accident happens . if your monkey so much as scratches someone , an animal control officer has the right to confiscate him to test him for rabies . when exotic animals are confiscated , they are often euthanized , since there is no law requiring a quarantine period for exotic animals as there is for domesticated animals like cats and dogs . if you have to go out of town and leave the monkey in someone elses care , make sure its someone the monkey has met many times and has come to trust . leaving the monkey with a total stranger could be stressful for him and lead to dangerous consequences . say his name when you feed him or offer them a toy , so hell begin to learn it . when he responds , give him a treat and praise him . teach him commands by showing him how to act . for example , if you say dance , start hopping around and dancing . when he learns a trick , give him treats and praise him ."
52,use fully secured bins . dont feed monkeys . pick the fruit from your trees . monkey - proof all the houses . avoid the use of plastic bags . spread the word .,how to repel monkeys from residential areas 1,"it is most likely that monkeys will be attracted to residential areas if they think they can access food easily . before you think about installing any alarms or security devices to repel moneys you should make sure you are not encouraging them to enter your neighbourhood . the first thing to do is check that there are no open or inadequately secured bins which monkeys can gain easy access to . use monkey - proof bins which can be properly secured and will not attract monkeys . you can secure bin lids with an elastic strap or bungee cord . tie all refuse bags with a double - knot and make sure that no food waste is left lying around , or spilling out of the bins . having easily accessible food in rubbish areas will encourage monkeys to move further into residential areas and even enter houses . as well as ensuring that food waste and rubbish areas are closed off and monkey - proofed , it is essential that you and your neighbours do not feed monkeys in the area . if the monkeys get fed they will come back looking for more food . you can try to cut off their access to human sources of food so they continue to forage in their natural habitat not in urban areas . do not feed monkeys or any other wild animals or you will attract them to where you live and make repelling them much harder . preventing and discouraging the monkeys from entering human settlements is the most important first step . once monkeys know there is a food source they are likely to visit every day . if you have fruit trees around your house or in your neighbourhood dont forget that these are a potential food source that could attract monkeys . you should harvest any fruit trees as soon as possible in order to reduce the chances of monkeys finding the fruit . if this is a consistent problem , consider whether you should continue to cultivate fruit trees . if you are growing vegetables in the ground , be sure to cover them with a strong wire mesh that is designed to resist primates . as well as securing all the bins , it is also important not to make it easy for monkeys to enter your house to look for food . to do this , ensure that all windows are secured . you can simply close the windows , or monkey - proof them with a mesh covering . meshing a window and keeping food out of sight will discourage curious monkeys . if you have monkeys in the area you should avoid using plastic bags as much as possible when you are walking around . put any plastic bags inside canvas bags instead . monkeys are curious and will snatch plastic bags which have food in and forage through rubbish bags . they can easily tear through the plastic so ensure they do not have the opportunity . if you live in an area that borders the edge of a forest where monkeys live , its important that you make sure your neighbours understand what to do to discourage monkeys from entering your residential area . if you secure the bins , close windows , and dont feed the monkeys , but other people arent so vigilant the problem wont be solved . be sure to speak to your neighbours and explain how discouraging monkeys is the most effective way to deal with it . education and awareness raising are essential for long - term solutions to be successful . you need everyone to buy in and take responsibility ."

- lean in when you â€˜wipe it off and look up into his eyes . touch his elbow , hold hands , brush his hair out of his face or gently put a hand on his knee . tearing down this barrier will help the both of you get past some of the hang - ups that you may have about physical contact . once youve broken the touch barrier keep on breaking it . when you laugh , place your hand on his arm . when you walk , grab his hand and hold it . hopefully he will meet you halfway and begin grabbing your hand too . cuddling lets him know that you like physical contact , and that you are really comfortable with him . it is one of the biggest clues you can give him - - and cuddling often leads to kissing . while you are cuddling , lean your head against his shoulder . entwine your fingers with his and lean back contentedly . all of these physical clues will tell your guy , i love being close to you , now kiss me you silly boy getting your guys full attention on your lips will make the idea of kissing you unavoidable . do everything you can to keep his attention on your lips . a classic approach is to bite your lip gently while looking at him . apply lip balm to your lips and let him watch you do it . just keep in mind that lip gloss can be sticky , and thus make your kiss sticky . use a lip balm or chapstick if you want to avoid a sticky situation . run an ice cube over your lips if its hot out . not only will this look seductive , it will also give your lips a shiny look similar to balm . lick your lips as if youre eating something juicy . if you are eating watermelon , ice cream , or something that is drip prone , let a little get on your lips and then slowly lick it off . just be careful to avoid looking like a slob when trying this - - you are going for temptress , not â€˜girl in serious need of a napkin . eye contact is a big part of clueing your guy in on the fact that you want to be kissed . look him in the eyes and smile gently . smile with your eyes . glance from his eyes to his lips a couple times , perhaps adding a flirtatious batting of your eyelashes . here is another way to flirt with your eyes when you two are looking at each other , especially when your faces are close together , hold eye contact for a moment , then drop your eyes bashfully . look down for a moment , and then glance back up . if you are hoping for a good night kiss , this is particularly important . when you are saying goodbye , hug him close and kiss him on the cheek . after kissing him on the cheek , look into his eyes . even if he doesnt kiss you right then , you will have shown him that you are perfectly fine with kissing and physical contact . when hugging him , you could place your head on his chest so that he holds you closer . if you do this , make sure to have some irresistible perfume on - - he wont be able to help but notice how delicious you smell . just because he is your boyfriend already doesnt mean you should stop flirting . flirting keeps a relationship light and healthy - - plus it will show him that youre still very into him . play coy and tease him but not too much . you could even tease him about not kissing you which is a pretty direct way of saying â€˜i want you to kiss me send him flirty text messages when you guys arent together . flirtatious , funny texts are a great way to be cute with him even when youre not around him . just keep in mind that you dont want to overload him with texts - - that can be a turn off . guys like to feel like they are the big , strong men in girls lives - - so make your guy feel that way . even if you dont necessarily need him to open a tightly - lidded jar , its a nice confidence boost for him when you say something like â€˜ooh look at those muscles this is , of course , another form of flirting , but it is the kind that will boost his confidence - - hopefully giving him the confidence to then lean in and kiss you being direct has its ups and downs . the ups are , you will most likely get results immediately , and it will show your guy how confident you are - - which is very sexy . the downside is that the results you get immediately might not be the ones you want . he may still need some time to overcome his shyness , or he might not be as into it as you thought . no matter what , you will get results - - and you are taking the pressure off him by telling him exactly what you want . you can make your request sexy and still direct . when you are hugging goodbye , lean in close so that your lips brush his ear and whisper something like kiss me or i want to kiss you . chances are , your words , and that little brush of your lips , will be enough to make him lose any shyness he might have and go right in for the kiss ."

girlfriend soon . and if youve both just eaten a meal , just quickly chew a piece of gum . dont make a big deal about it or shell know that youre self - conscious about kissing her . you can also put on some lip balm a few hours before to soften up your lips , but dont use it right before you make a move or your lips wont feel too pleasant . once youve got her alone , you cant just swoop in for the kiss or it will feel a bit forced . instead , you have to show your girlfriend that you care about her by making her feel special . give her a compliment , like , you look so pretty tonight , or say something nice like , ive had so much fun with you today . you dont have to try too hard to show her that you really do care about her . turn off your phone , look into her eyes , and show her

if shes always trying to pull away when youre alone together , and moves further and further away from you , then she may not be ready to take it to the next level with you . this doesnt mean that she doesnt like you , but it does mean that shes not ready yet . you shouldnt go from standing two feet apart from your girlfriend to planting a big wet one on her face , or shell be caught off guard .

you to start creeping all over her body . you can touch her in safe , pg areas to show her that you care , but you dont want to creep her out by suddenly touching her in a place where shes definitely not ready to be touched . the sneak attack kiss . avoid just jumping in and kissing her without any indication of whats going to happen . though some element of surprise is nice , you dont want your girlfriend to not know whats going on when you make your big move . once youve made physical contact , all you have to do is move a bit closer to her until your faces are very close together . if youre sitting , then youll both have to turn your bodies a bit . if youre standing , you can put your arms around her waist and move closer to her . this should happen slowly and naturally , and you can make eye contact while you get closer . you can lightly lick your lips a bit to soften them , if youre not too obvious about it . you dont want to kiss your girlfriend head on , or your noses will get in the way . you should tilt your head slightly in one direction and she should tilt her head slightly in the other . dont worry if you dont get it perfect the first time , or if you both dont tilt your heads that much . this isnt so crucial for a regular kiss , so dont overthink it and tilt your head too much . heres your big moment just lean forward a bit and make the connection ,

you can place your hands on her waist , her upper back , or her knee or shoulder if youre sitting down . as long as youre not touching her anywhere inappropriate , a little bit of touch can help the girl feel more in the moment . dont overwhelm her , though . if shes not touching you except with her lips , only a bit of a light touch on your end will be enough . this sounds silly , but its important . you may be so nervous or excited about finally kissing your girlfriend that you may forget to perform one of the most basic functions of the human being . that means breathing in and out , just as you normally would , while youre kissing her . if you only kiss for a few seconds , breathing before and after is ok too . after a few seconds , you can slowly pull away , while continuing to look into your girlfriends eyes . dont instantly pull away like youve been scorched by a flame . instead , look at her , smile , and gently move away . you can brush her face or hair for an extra touch . lets face it . middle school can be awkward . kissing for the first time can be weird . but you should do the best you can to make your girl feel comfortable , and to say something like , that was nice , to let her know it was a special moment for you . dont just take her hand and walk away to join the party and pretend it never happened . it can be hard for guys to express their feelings ,

wanting to kiss you . make sure you brush twice each day , and floss at least once . it is good to get in this habit not only for your first kiss , but for your own health as well . have breath mints handy so you can toss one in your mouth if you end up eating or drinking before the time you plan to kiss the other person . dont chew gum . although it will give you fresh breath , having gum in your

more likely . for example , if it is the end of the night just before you both go home , or if you are alone in a quiet moment . although it is ok to take a quick peek every now and then , it is usually better to keep your eyes closed . if your partner realizes you have your eyes open , heshe might feel uncomfortable . it will also help you to relax if your eyes are closed . when the kiss happens , dont immediately try to stick your tongue in hisher mouth . instead , start out by gently kissing with just your lips , and if the kiss continues to that , proceed slowly . there is no need to rush when it comes to kissing . the worst thing you can do is to over think your first kiss . remember that no matter what happens , it is only one kiss , and there will be many others . once you get the first kiss out of the way , you can practice getting better at it . enjoy the moment you only get one first kiss , and you will likely remember it for your entire life . be present during the kiss . dont start thinking about how you cant wait to tell your friends or write about it in your diary . simply enjoy it . think about why you want to experience your first kiss is it because you

nervous before a kiss , and this could be your brains way of saying you arent ready . dont make too big a deal out of it . when youre going to do something that scares you , it can be easy to make it seem like a much bigger deal than it is , and this can make you even more nervous have your plan ready and then keep your mind off the kiss until youre ready to do it . figuring out what another person wants based on signals is hard , and its easy to misinterpret what people want just based on body language . to avoid making a mistake , simply ask your partner before going in for the kiss .

82,learn the best knots for tying up a horse ahead of time . learn to tie a quick - release knot . learn another quick - release knot . learn to tie a bowline knot . use caution when tying knots .,how to tie up a horse 1,"the most common knots used to tie a horse are quick - release knots , of which there are several varieties , and the bowline knot . quick - release knots are easy to tie , and while they will tighten up if the horse pulls against the rope , are still easy to release with a quick tug of the trailing rope . the bowline is a bit less convenient to tie and untie , but will not tighten up if the horse pulls on it . also , some horses are quite adept at untying quick release knots . if you are going to leave your tied horse unsupervised or know that he has untied a quick release in the past , the bowline is the safer option . practice tying these knots ahead of time , before you use them with an actual horse . this quick - release knot should not tighten if your horse pulls against it , and is very easy to untie . first make a fold in the rope called a â€˜bight and fold it over the pole you are tying to , or through a ring . then make another bight in the part of the rope that leads to the horse called the standing end . pull the second bight through the first bight . then with your other hand , make a bight in the loose end of the rope , and pull this through the second bight . to tighten the knot , pull on the standing end . to release the knot , simply tug on the loose end . this quick - release knot is easy to tie and untie , and can be finished off in a daisy - chain fashion to take up extra rope , and prevent your horse pulling or tripping on the loose end . first loop the rope over a pole , or through a ring . then twist the loose end of the rope to form a loop . hold the loop in your left hand , and with your right hand , wrap the loose end over the standing end . fold the loose end over into a bight , and pull the bight through the loop in your left hand . pull on the standing end to tighten the knot . pull on the loose end to release the rope . to create an extra - secure knot that is harder for your horse to untie , create another bight in the loose end of the rope , and feed it through the last loop . repeat this daisy - chain process as many times as needed to use up the loose end of the rope . this is a secure knot that will not tighten if the horse pulls on it . you can untie it quickly , but your horse cannot . first take the standing end of the rope in your left hand and wrap the loose end over the pole . then twist a loop in the standing end , and feed the loose end through the loop . then wrap the loose end back over the standing end , and through the loop again going the other way . pull firmly on both the loose and standing ends to snug the knot . never wrap a rope around your hand or finger , or put your hand inside or through any loop or bight while tying up a horse . if the horse were to jerk quickly , the loop could tighten on your hand and cause serious injury . be careful to avoid doing this while you practice tying knots to avoid learning unsafe knot - tying habits ."
83,"note that saddling normally mainly takes place on the left side of the horse .  have the saddle pad and saddle ready . place the saddle pad on the horses back . check from the front of the horse that the saddle pad is even on both sides of the horse . before putting the saddle on the horse , hook the stirrup on the opposite side of where you are standing up over the saddle horn so it doesnt get caught under the saddle when you put it on the horse . lay the saddle on top of the saddle pad evenly . put the stirrups and cinch down to hang at the horses sides . make the horse put its front leg , on the side you are cinching the saddle on , forward to avoid pinching the skin when you tighten the cinch . if your saddle has a back cinch , tighten the front cinch first and then tighten the back one . check and make sure the girth is not pinching the horse anywhere .",how to put a saddle on 2,"whether it be on a saddle stand or a nearby fence , have it ready to be put straight on the horse so you do not have to make the horse wait any longer than necessary . make sure the top of the saddle pad is covering the horses withers . a rule of thumb is to put the saddle pad a little more forward than it really should be so that when you put the saddle on top of the pad , the pad can slide back a little . you dont want more saddle pad on one side than the other , same goes for the girth if that is on the opposite side of where you are standing . western saddles are generally heavier than english saddles so you may need to swing the saddle to get enough momentum and get the saddle on the horses back . set the saddle on the horses back gently . the front of the saddle should be about 2 12 inches away from the front of the saddle pad . make sure that the saddle in even on both sides of the horse and not lopsided . do not tighten the girth too quickly because this tends to lead to a horse learning how to bloat himself to make the girth loose when being saddled ."
84,tie your horse by its halter . choose a safe place to secure your horse . tie your horse up away from other horses . secure the horse at eye - level or higher . leave the right amount of slack . shelter a horse that will be tied for a long time . keep a knife handy for cutting rope in emergency situations . use caution around tied horses . untie the horse before removing its halter .,how to tie up a horse 2,"you should only tie a horse up with a rope connected to a well - fitting halter . tying a horse up by the bridle , either directly to the bit or to the reigns , can cause the horse pain and serious injury . only tie your horse to a solid object that the horse cannot break or pull over . horses are very strong and can pull with tremendous strength when frightened . if you tie your horse to a fence or railing , inspect the poles or rails and be sure to choose one that is not damaged or corroded . make sure the area in the immediate vicinity of the horse is clear of dangerous objects the horse might step on or run into . if you must tie your horse to something the horse â€˜could break , tie a loop of string around the object and then tie the horses rope to the string , instead of the object itself . if the horse does decide to make a break for it , this will minimize property damage . make sure to tie your horse up far enough away from other horses that they cannot fight . it is best not to tie your horse up around other horses at all , until it is used to being tied . do not tie the horse to an object on or near the ground . the horse could step on the rope , trip on it , or get tangled up on it , and potentially suffer serious injury . you can tie a horse to something higher than his head . leave about 2 to 3 feet 0 . 6 to 0 . 9Â m of rope between the horse and the object it is tied to . this is enough rope to allow the horse to comfortably move his head . leaving more rope can lead to injury . if your horse will be tied up for a number of hours , be sure that there is food and water available , and that the horse is sheltered from the elements . tying your horse to a sturdy fence post under the shade of a tree might be an option , or to a sturdy post or gate inside a barn . check on the horse frequently , especially if it is new to being tied up . it is always a good idea to carry a knife , in case the horse manages to pull the knot tight and you need to release it in a hurry . cut through the rope between the post or ring and the knot . be sure to hold the knife so the blade is facing away from both you and your horse , so that no one is injured if the rope abruptly gives way . never step over or under a tie rope , and remain well out of kicking range when walking behind the horse . speak to your horse softly before approaching it , to avoid startling it , and keep your hands on the horse as you walk alongside it . untie the horse and turn the horse to where you want it to go before you remove the halter . quick - release knots should be very easy to untie . for the bowline , simply untie the knot using both hands ."
85,make sure the harness isnt too tight . use leashes just for the yard . dont walk your guinea pig .,how to walk a guinea pig on a leash 1,"if you put on a harness , make sure it is loose enough . you should be able to put a finger or two between the harness and the guinea pig . if its too tight , it could harm the guinea pigs back over time and chaff under his armpits . it may not be a good idea to put a harness on at all . some owners have had trouble with harnesses harming guinea pigs backs after theyve worn it several times . if you insist on using a leash , make sure you just do it in the yard . that is , you can use a leash to keep your guinea pig from wandering too far . however , you need to supervise the guinea pig the whole time . a leash isnt license to leave your guinea pig alone outside . also , dont tug on the leash . just let your guinea pig roam about . make sure the leash is always loose , and your guinea pig doesnt get tangled in it . while you can put your guinea pig in a harness , its not a good idea to walk it on a leash . the tugging sensation can harm the guinea pigs delicate spine very easily . in addition , most guinea pigs wont take to walking , meaning they cant be trained to walk beside you on a leash . in addition , guinea pigs can easily slip out of harnesses , so they can escape before you can catch them . therefore , trying to walk a guinea pig in a street isnt a good idea . it could get away from you and be harmed ."
86,designate one area for guinea pigs . hide electrical cords . put hazards out of reach . separate the other pets . let everyone know the guinea pigs are out . give them enough exercise time . dont forget to provide food and water .,how to walk a guinea pig on a leash 2,"you dont want to give guinea pigs the full run of the house because there are too many hazards . in addition , guinea pigs can get lost in the shuffle or be scared by loud noises . consider picking a single room that doesnt have too many places for the guinea pig to hide . a hallway or bathroom works well . places like the kitchen have too many places for the guinea pigs to hide or squeeze into . also remember that guinea pigs like to chew . if you love the furniture in a particular room , you may not want to put your guinea pigs in there . another option is to use a wire pen or cage that you set up in a room . guinea pigs are happy to chew on electrical cords if you give them the chance . make sure any cords are up out of reach of the guinea pigs or that you pick a room that doesnt have them near the floor . move any plants and other hazards out of reach . plastic bags , for instance , can pose a suffocation hazard . make sure to also pick up any dead leaves , as many houseplants are poisonous to guinea pigs . if you have larger animals in your home , they should not be in the same room as the guinea pigs when they are out . they could attack or injure the guinea pigs by just following their instincts . that way , they wont rush into the room without checking to see where the guinea pigs are . in addition , if guinea pigs are underfoot without the familys knowledge , they could easily be stepped on . you could use a note or sign on the door to help family members remember . this step also warns your family not to let other pets in . try to provide at least 3 hours outside of the cage a day if the guinea pigs are in a cage that isnt large enough for them . that means that if your guinea pig has less than 7 . 5 square feet , you need to provide this time out of the cage every day . otherwise , your guinea pig could get bored . if you let your guinea pigs out of their cage for extended periods , dont forget they still need food and water . if they cant go back to their cage , make sure you have food and water out for them ."
87,place them in an enclosure . keep your guinea pigs cool . dont let them go out on damp grass . provide food and water . check for poisonous plants . stay outside .,how to walk a guinea pig on a leash 3,"outside , create an enclosure or fenced in area for them to play in . you can use a wire fence or cage , as long as it doesnt leave gaps that your guinea pigs can escape through . guinea pigs can stand too much heat , so make sure you keep them cool when they go outside . for one , you should always provide them with shade , so they can cool down . in addition , only let them out during cooler times of the day in the summer . guinea pigs prefer temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees fahrenheit . while they can stand a bit more variation , you dont want to go too much colder or warmer . damp grass can give your pig a chill , and thats not good for them . also , make sure you arent setting them down on grass that has been sprayed with insecticides or other chemicals , as that can be damaging for your guinea pig . once again , you want to be sure to always provide your guinea pig with food and water . water is especially important when your guinea pig is outside because it can easily get dehydrated when it is warm out . guinea pigs love to chew on any plant in their vicinity , which is fine when theyre munching on grass . however , some plants are poisonous to guinea pigs , so you want to make sure they dont have access to those . use a database like cornells httppoisonousplants . ansci . cornell . eduindex . html to look up poisonous plants in your area . many common plants like daisies and buttercups are poisonous to guinea pigs . if you keep your guinea pigs just on grass without weeds , you should be fine . you do not want to leave your guinea pig unattended outside . for one , if your enclosure doesnt have a roof , your guinea pig could easily be carried off by a predator . it could even happen if your enclosure does have a roof . in addition , you want to make sure your guinea pigs dont wriggle out and escape . also , because guinea pigs are susceptible to heat stroke , you want to keep an eye on them while outside . signs of heatstroke include lethargy , a limp body , trouble breathing , a rapid pulse , and a wet chin . your guinea pig may also feel hot to the touch . check the ears to see if they feel extra warm . if you notice signs of heatstroke , bring the guinea pig indoors . use tepid water not cold because it can cause shock to dab around the ears and feet . you can even dip its feet in water . once the guinea pig seems cooler , take it to the vet ."
88,buy a large enough cage . buy one commercially . build your own .,how to walk a guinea pig on a leash 4,"a large cage is important because it gives your guinea pig a large area to explore . the larger the cage is , the better off your guinea pig will be . at a minimum , each guinea pig should have 7 . 5 square feet of cage . thats a cage thats approximately 3 by 2 . 5 feet . if you can , go for a bigger cage , so your guinea pig will need less exercise outside of its cage . you can buy a cage for a guinea pig . however , most cages that are labelled for guinea pigs are not big enough . you can find ones meant for other animals , though , that will work for guinea pigs . pick one that has metal bars on the side , not wood , as guinea pigs cant chew through metal . also , make sure it has a solid floor . guinea pigs feet are easily damaged by floors that are made of wire , so it needs to be solid to protect your guinea pig . go for a larger floor space rather than one that has many levels . floor space is more important . another option is making your own . you can make your own cages out of wire fences on the floor with other materials underneath . one option is to use corrugated correx or corrugated coroplast , available from sign making shops . start with cube grids . cube grids can be reconfigured to any size to make an outward cage . cut the correx or coroplast to fit . you can use the material as a floor , then use more of it to create a border around the floor . tape it together from the outside . add newspapers and hay for your guinea pig to complete the cage ."
89,train her to come to you when she is called . practice the stand up command . do the turn in a circle command . train your guinea pig to push a ball . teach her to jump through a hoop . practice litter box training .,how to train your guinea pig,"like most pets , guinea pigs can learn to come to you when called with a little practice and motivation in the form a treat . make sure you use your guinea pigs name often and address her by name when you feed her and give her treats . you can also practice getting her to come to you when called by taking her out of her cage and placing her a few feet away from you . call her by name and hold out one of her favorite treats . your guinea pig should be motivated to run to you . when she does so , give her a treat as a reward . practice this at least once a day and over time she should come to you when called by name outside her cage and inside her cage . this is another simple command you can teach your guinea pig using a treat . hold a treat above your guinea pigs head so she has to stand on her back legs to get to it . say the command stand up and then let her have the treat once she is on her back legs . repeat this command once a day on a consistent basis . over time , your guinea pig will stand up when you command her , even when you are not holding a treat . you can practice this command with your guinea pig when she is in her cage or outside of her cage . hold a treat in your hand and let your guinea pig approach you . when she is in front of you , move your hand so you make a circle , and say the command circle . your guinea pig should follow the motion of your hand , with the treat , and make a circle . once she makes a circle , give her the treat . repeat this once a day until she can circle on command , without the treat . use a ball that is not too heavy and not too big , like a tennis ball , so your guinea pig can maneuver it easily . you will also need a treat that is long and flat , like a carrot stick . place the carrot stick on the ground and then put the tennis ball on top of the carrot stick . encourage your guinea pig to try to push the ball off the treat so she can access the treat and say push the ball . repeat these steps and over time you should be able to remove the treat so she learns to push the ball on her own , without the treat . you will need a hoop that is about 6 - 10 in diameter , or you can use pipe cleaners to form a hoop that is close to that size . the top of an ice cream tub , or a tennis racket without the strings would also work . make sure that whatever you use as a hoop , there are no sharp edges or anything your guinea pig can get stuck on as she learns to jump . begin by holding the hoop so it touches the ground or the bottom of your guinea pigs cage . hold a treat on one side of the hoop , or have someone help you by holding the treat as you hold the hoop . call your guinea pigs name and make sure she can see the treat on the other side of the hoop . say the command through the hoop . you may need to give your guinea pig a nudge or a gentle push to convince her to jump through the hoop . over time , she will be motivated enough by the treat to jump through the hoop and get it . praise her and give her the treat when she goes through the hoop . repeat these steps until your guinea pig starts to go through the hoop on her own , without the motivation of the treat . many guinea pig owners teach their pets to go to the bathroom in a litter box . however , this takes a lot of patience and practice . when you are first litter box training your guinea pig , be prepared for some accidents and do not scold or punish your guinea pig if this happens . your guinea pig will respond more to positive reinforcement and acknowledgement . to litter train your guinea pig , place a litter box in the spot in her cage where she goes to the bathroom often . place a handful of hay in the box and a few fecal pellets . when you notice your guinea pig using the litter box , give her a treat as praise . over time , she will understand that using the litter box is a good thing that leads to treats and she will start to use it on a regular basis ."
90,observe your guinea pig . buy a litter tray . prepare the litter tray . watch her behavior . keep up the litter tray . be patient . start small . lay out her litter tray . cover up the remaining corners . expand the area .,how to potty train a guinea pig,"before you put a litter box in your guinea pigs cage , you need to watch her to see where she normally goes to the bathroom . guinea pigs like to scent mark their territory , so your guinea pig will likely scope out a corner of her cage to pee and poop in regularly . although there is one corner where she will go most often , this does not mean she will always go in this corner . just pick the place she frequents the most . once you have figured out the best location for your guinea pigs litter box , you need to buy a tray that will fit nicely in that corner . pick one that is the right size for the cage as well as one that will be comfortable for your guinea pig . you dont want it to be too small because then she wont have enough room to sit and go to the potty . you can buy small litter trays at your local pet store that are for small rodents . you also need to put in brand new bedding . otherwise , she will smell her old pee and might want to go there . the litter tray needs to be filled with the same kind of bedding that you keep in your guinea pig cage . although it is called a litter tray , the substance used for the tray is not what is typically considered litter but is actually just the same hay or straw that you keep in your guinea pig cage . you should take a handful or two from the cage where she has already pooped and peed and lay that in the litter tray at first . then you should set the try in the cage that you picked earlier . using hay at first that has already been soiled will lead her to the tray because her scent will be all over it . the kinds of bedding that work great for guinea pigs are aspen , wood pulp , hay , and straw . there are also different varieties of litter pellets and bedding that have been vet recommended as well . never buy cedar or corn cob for your guinea pig because they are toxic . dont put her food and water near or in the litter box . she will not like to potty where she eats . you can also put a little bit of eating straw in her litter tray as well so she will feel comfortable in there and might be able to munch a little while she goes to the bathroom . once you place the try in her cage , watch to see if she uses it . since it smells like her and is in a familiar location , she should use it most of the time . if you find that she doesnt use it , you might have to take it out and try again . there might be something wrong with the tray that is deterring her from using it . when you see her using her litter box , give her a treat . this will encourage her behavior and make her want to use it more so you will give her more treats . if the sides on the litter tray look too big for her , you should use sharp scissors or a small saw or knife and cut the excess edge off . this will make it short enough for her to get into the tray . you should only clean out the litter tray every three days or so . you can dump out what is in the litter tray and replenish it with new litter . you should only wash the tray every other week . this will make sure that her smell will remain on the tray and she will likely go back to it . you should use litter that is best for guinea pigs . if you arent sure what to use , ask at your local pet store or vets office . although most guinea pigs will learn to use a litter tray most or all of the time , there are some guinea pigs that might never learn to use it . keep trying to get your guinea pig to use the tray , but even if she only uses it half the time , that is that much less you have to clean up out of her cage . never punish your guinea pig or yell at her . she doesnt understand why she needs to go to the potty in the same place all the time . encourage the good behavior , but dont try punishment . it doesnt work on guinea pigs . once you have trained your guinea pig in her cage , you may want to train your guinea pig outside of her cage during play time . start somewhere small . it needs to be an area that you can control easily and where you can keep an eye on her . you should make sure there arent any small vents that she can run into without getting out . a bathroom or hallway is a great place to start . they are small , have few wires that are close to the ground , and have very few places for your guinea pig to hide . this will help keep her safe and help you keep track of her while still allowing her to exercise . you need to pick a dark , out of the way corner of the room to place her litter tray . this will encourage her to seek that corner out and use it to potty . since this will be the only thing that has her smell on it , she will be able to find it , not matter which corner you put it in . try to leave some litter in it that has already been used . this way it will feel like her territory . if you want , you can let her loose for a little while first to see which corner she prefers to go to the potty and then place her litter tray there . guinea pigs like to use the potty in dark corners away from other things , just like they do in their cages . to help persuade your guinea pig to use the corner where you placed her tray , you need cover up the remaining corners so she cannot run there to potty . if she has no other dark corner to pee or poop in , she will be more likely to use her litter tray in the other corner . if you want to , you can also place newspaper around the room in case she has an accident . this will make it easier to clean up . once your guinea pig gets used to the area , you can expand it a little at a time . since she should already know where her litter tray is , she should use it even though her play area is bigger . just make sure you keep wires off the floor and hard to reach hiding spaces covered so you dont injure or lose your guinea pig . just like with training in the cage , do not scold her if she uses the bathroom somewhere else . you can reward her when she goes in her litter tray , which will be a positive reminder to use the area ."

93,"put a saddle blanket or pad on your horses back . position the saddle on the blanket . position the stirrup , cinches , and straps on the left side of the horse .",how to tighten your horses western girth 1,"the saddle blanket protects the horses body from friction from the leather saddle , and is vital for a safe ride . it also keeps the saddle clean from the horses body which will sweat and froth with the exertion of a ride . if you dont have a blanket , you need one to properly tack your horse . you can get a saddle blanket at any farming supply or agriculture store . you can choose a traditional woven blanket which is folded in half for use , or you can buy a felt or cotton pad which is less likely to bunch under the saddle or catch burrs if you ride in a field . be sure you brush the horse and ensure there are no burrs in its coat or any injuries to its skin . position the blanket slightly over the horses withers the ridge between its shoulder blades . first put the blanket down a bit too far toward the neck , then pull it back toward the horses tail until its in the correct position . this method smooths the hair under the blanket so that it lies flat and doesnt itch or bother the animal . this process might seem cumbersome and can take some practice before it becomes easy , especially if youre used to the english saddle which has less straps and other things dangling down . stand next to the horses left shoulder and keep your feet shoulder - width apart . hook the right stirrup up over the saddle horn so that it wont get caught under the saddle as you lift it , then swing the saddle up and over the horses back so that your right arm is across the horses back . be sure to practice good lifting techniques to avoid injury to your back or leg muscles saddles can weigh from 10 - 35 pounds and swinging it without proper posture could injure your muscles or joints . as you put the saddle over the blanket , be sure that you grab the stirrups the leather loops for the riders feet , cinches , and straps any leather hanging down and hold them out of the way so that they dont get stuck under the saddle . the process of getting the saddle and blanket in the right place might cause them both to slide too far back in that case , start over with the blanket first . this is the side you have been standing on to put the blanket and saddle on . you can keep the left stirrup up over the saddle horn the knob on top of the saddle for the rider to hold for better access , but bring the tie down to the horses side ."
94,attach the girth . cinch the ties . put the finishing touches on .,how to tighten your horses western girth 2,"most saddles have a removable leather strap called a girth or latigo that attaches with buckles to the tie on the horses right side some have a girth attached to the tie , in which case you can skip this step . buckle the girth securely to the tie that hangs down by the horses front leg on the right side of the horse . walk in front of the horse back to its left side , and then reach under the horses body and pass the girth underneath the horses chest . the girth should be pulled up to the buckle on the left side of the horses saddle , where it should be fastened much like the other side using a buckle . cinch it tightly but gently dont force it to go tighter than feels snug and secure . you should wait until the horse exhales to cinch it , because if you tighten it while the horse has its lungs full of air it will be too loose when the horse exhales to be safe . some horses intentionally take a deep breath right before you tighten the girth . when they do that they get bigger around , so when they breathe out the girth is too loose - just the way they like it this is called bloating , and some horses do it because a girth doesnt fit them or their skin is being pinched under the girth . if your horse does this , you might want to check that the girth itself is long enough for your horse and not causing irritation or pain . you can secure the additional length of the tie by passing it through the d - ring at the top of the tie , wrapping it around the tie and pulling it through at the top like a mens necktie . this will keep it up and out of the way of the horses legs even if the horse runs . before you mount up , be sure you didnt forget anything . be sure the stirrups are down on either side . double - check that everything is tight because if its loose and you get on youll slide right off be sure that the bridle is on correctly . now mount up and ride dont forget to mount from the left side ."
95,watch out for a shifting saddle . notice if your saddle seems to bounce up and down . dismount and inspect the cinch . tighten the cinch before mounting .,how to tighten your horses western girth 3,"if you feel that you are having to lean to one side to keep your balance or keep upright , its probably because the saddle was either placed on incorrectly or has shifted because it is loose . you can know for sure by looking at the pommel the horn that you hold with one hand while riding . if the horn or pommel , the knob that sticks up on the saddle for the rider to hold is not in perfect alignment with the horses mane , the saddle has shifted off - center . the saddle may have shifted because it was too loose , or it may have shifted because you are putting too much weight on one stirrup and not evenly distributing your weight this happens all the time , especially to new riders , and especially if youre riding the horse in circles . you can try to shift the saddle back by putting your weight on the opposite side stirrup , but if the saddle moves too easily it is probably too loose . dismount and adjust it . while you might do a lot of bouncing out of the saddle if your horse is trotting or cantering , the saddle itself should never leave the horses back . if its moving up and down as the horse moves , it will injure the horses back . if the saddle itself seems to leave the horses body as you trot , you must immediately dismount and tighten the girth . if youre not sure if the saddle is on properly , dont keep riding , even if youre worried that others will think you dont know what youre doing . every rider has to adjust the saddle sometimes , and no one will think less of you for putting your horses comfort and your own safety first . if someone is with you , they can inspect the cinch for you . this is more reliable than doing it yourself since your weight in the saddle will cause more give to the girth and make it looser . have the person check to see if they can pull the girth itself an inch or more away from the horses body while you are in the saddle . if they can , its too loose . you most likely will not have to repeat all the steps again , but you will need to loosen the tie and unbuckle the girth from the horses left side to re - tighten . make a note of what position the buckle is in before you remove it , and then ensure that you tighten it to the next notch or two , if the saddle was very loose as you re - cinch it ."
96,build a trustworthy bond with your piggy . research different training methods . choose the training method that works best for you and your guinea pig . gather the materials that you will need for training .,how to teach a guinea pig to do tricks 1,"having a stable relationship with an animal makes them so much easier to train . if your guinea pig doesnt trust you , or thinks of you as a scary giant that comes to try and communicate all of the time , it will be more difficult to teach . the trust of an animal is a very fragile thing . think of it as if you are a mountain climber , trying to climb the mountain of training . the peak is success , and the rope that you depend on to get you to the top is the relationship with the animal you wish to train . would you rather have a weak rope - aka a weak relationship - or a stronger , more dependable one if you choose the weak rope , and it snaps , youll come tumbling back down to where you started . the strong rope has a better chance of holding up , though , be aware that if you are constantly tampering with the rope , even the strongest has a chance of breaking . if you arent sure of your current relationship with your pet , it is best to keep working with them until they trust you enough to allow you to pick them up and pet them . this may take longer with skittish piggies , but never give up . once your piggy is willing to trust you and do what you say , its time to start looking into the many methods of training . guinea pigs are very fragile , and their brains work a bit differently from a dogs , so every training method will need to be tweaked before use with a guinea pig . clicker training and verbal markers are a few ways to train your guinea pig . clicker training is slightly easier than using a verbal marker , and requires a clicker , while using a verbal marker is more difficult and can have different results than what is expected . some owners have different needs than others , and some animals need a specific type of training . as mentioned before , any training method chosen will need to be tweaked in many different ways to suit a guinea pig rather than a dog . different methods require different materials . some may need to be purchased , while others can just be found around the house . training a guinea pig is not as expensive as training a dog , per se , but cost is made up in effort . if you choose to clicker train your guinea pig , you will need a soft clicker - be sure that it is not too loud or sharp for a guinea pigs ears - and , of course , treats . treats that have worked well for many guinea pig owners include chopped up carrots , celery with veins removed , and lettuce torn up into little pieces . whatever the reward may be , always make sure that it is quick , chewable , and guinea pig - safe ."

98,"condition your guinea pig to the clicker or verbal marker . once your guinea pig is well conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker , begin to slowly ease them into performing basic commands . begin teaching your guinea pig .",how to teach a guinea pig to do tricks 2,"to do this , put your guinea pig in a safe area - such as its cage - and click the clicker or say the verbal marker . a second or so after clicking the clicker , give your guinea pig a treat . repeat this several times until you think your guinea pig understands what the click , or marker , means . occasionally , this will take a long time . to see if your guinea pig is properly conditioned to the clicker or verbal marker , act normal for several minutes , talking and playing with the guinea pig , and then , suddenly click the clicker or say the marker clearly and firmly . if your guinea pig looks at you , expecting a treat , they have been properly conditioned and you can move on with training . if they keep about their business , they do not yet understand what the marker means and need to be worked with on conditioning a bit more . dont be discouraged if your guinea pig does this . skittish , hyper , stubborn , or impatient guinea pigs will be more difficult to train . it takes a lot of patience to get your guinea pig to learn a trick , and often times they will respond to a hand motion rather than a word - for example , if you were teaching your guinea pig to stand up , it would be easier for them to grasp if you held your finger over their head as an indication to do the trick in contrast to just saying stand up . many people , before beginning to train their guinea pigs , work on targeting . teaching targeting to a guinea pig is quite simple - to do so , hold a finger or some kind of long stick somewhere a few inches away from your guinea pig and wait . as soon as they get near the finger or stick and touch it , click or say the marker and treat . do this about twenty or thirty times , or until your guinea pig touches it efficiently several times in a row . this may make training much easier . there are several different methods , and some are easier than others . try to get your guinea pig out for at least one 5 - 10 minute session each day . if either you or the pig become frustrated , treat and put them back in their cage for a little while . keep in mind that guinea pigs brains work differently than a cats or dogs , so they may not process information as quickly as a larger animal . patience is key ."
99,"place your guinea pig in a piggy - proof area that both of you are comfortable in . hold a treat - or , if your pig has learned targeting , a finger - above the guinea pigs head . once your guinea pig stands up on its hind legs , allow it to drop back down to all fours , and then click or use the verbal marker and treat . continue to do this until your guinea pig does it correctly every time .",how to teach a guinea pig to do tricks 3,"ensure that there is nothing to pose a danger to your guinea pig , or you , and that there is nothing that your guinea pig can crawl under , save for a hidey house for them to retreat to if they feel the need . training inside the cage works just as well in the beginning , if your guinea pig is more comfortable in their cage . it will become harder to train inside the cage , however , as you move on to more advanced tricks that require equipment , such as climbing over things . keep in mind that anything you do use for a trick , such as a hoop , must be adjusted to fit the needs of your piggy . remember that not all guinea pigs have the ability to focus on one task for more than a few minutes at a time , so changing up the training routine may help a guinea pig to learn more easily and not become bored . make sure that you are not holding it impossibly high , as the idea is to make your guinea pig stand up on its hind legs to receive the treat . dont keep it too low either , or your pig may stand up , snatch the treat , and get away with it without learning anything . this could happen with any trick . praise your guinea pig as if they just did the hardest thing in the world , and then repeat . try to time the click or word so that the moment they drop back down , you perform the action . this will eventually lead to the mindset of your piggy being like this trick - - clickmarker - - treat - - praise . it may take time for the guinea pig to realize this , but when they do , training is much easier . when your guinea pig does this trick , make sure they do not stand up for too long , and allow them to lean on your hand for support if needed . the guinea pig may stand up on its hind legs without you giving them the motion , which is good - it shows that the guinea pig understands what it has to do to get the treat . however , it is important for them to wait for you to give the signal . if they stand up , just watch quietly , and when they finish , put the treat or finger over their head again . this part may take a while , and it may cause some confusion , but it is essential for your guinea pig to learn to wait for your command , and when they do , its very rewarding ."
